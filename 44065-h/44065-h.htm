MR. COLLEY CIBBER, &amp;c.</p>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER X.</h2>


<div class="chapquot">
<p><i>The recruited Actors in the</i> Hay-Market <i>encourag'd by a Subscription</i>.
Drury-Lane <i>under a particular Management</i>. <i>The Power of a
Lord-Chamberlain over the Theatres consider'd. How it had
been formerly exercis'd. A Digression to Tragick Authors.</i></p>
</div>


<p>Having shewn the particular Conduct of the
Patentee in refusing so fair an Opportunity
of securing to himself both Companies under his sole
Power and Interest, I shall now lead the Reader,
after a short View of what pass'd in this new Establishment
of the <i>Hay-Market</i> Theatre, to the Acci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>dents
that the Year following compell'd the same
Patentee to receive both Companies, united, into the
<i>Drury-Lane</i> Theatre, notwithstanding his Disinclination
to it.</p>

<p>It may now be imagin'd that such a Detachment
of Actors from <i>Drury-Lane</i> could not but give a
new Spirit to those in the <i>Hay-Market</i>; not only by
enabling them to act each others Plays to better
Advantage, but by an emulous Industry which had
lain too long inactive among them, and without
which they plainly saw they could not be sure of
Subsistence. Plays by this means began to recover
a good Share of their former Esteem and Favour;
and the Profits of them in about a Month enabled
our new Menager to discharge his Debt (of something
more than Two hundred Pounds) to his old
Friend the Patentee, who had now left him and his
Troop in trust to fight their own Battles. The
greatest Inconvenience they still laboured under was
the immoderate Wideness of their House, in which,
as I have observ'd, the Difficulty of Hearing may be
said to have bury'd half the Auditors Entertainment.
This Defect seem'd evident from the much
better Reception several new Plays (first acted
there) met with when they afterwards came to be
play'd by the same Actors in <i>Drury-Lane</i>: Of this
Number were the <i>Stratagem</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the <i>Wife's Resent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>ment</i>;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
to which I may add the <i>Double Gallant</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This
last was a Play made up of what little was tolerable in
two or three others that had no Success, and were laid
aside as so much Poetical Lumber; but by collecting
and adapting the best Parts of them all into one Play,
the <i>Double Gallant</i> has had a Place every Winter
amongst the Publick Entertainments these Thirty
Years. As I was only the Compiler of this Piece I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
did not publish it in my own Name; but as my having
but a Hand in it could not be long a Secret, I have
been often treated as a Plagiary on that Account:
Not that I think I have any right to complain of
whatever would detract from the Merit of that sort
of Labour, yet a Cobler may be allow'd to be useful
though he is not famous:<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And I hope a Man is not
blameable for doing a little Good, tho' he cannot do
as much as another? But so it is&mdash;Twopenny
Criticks must live as well as Eighteenpenny Authors!<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>While the Stage was thus recovering its former
Strength, a more honourable Mark of Favour was
shewn to it than it was ever known before or since
to have receiv'd. The then Lord <i>Hallifax</i> was not
only the Patron of the Men of Genius of this Time,
but had likewise a generous Concern for the Reputation
and Prosperity of the Theatre, from whence
the most elegant Dramatick Labours of the Learned,
he knew, had often shone in their brightest Lustre.
A Proposal therefore was drawn up and addressed
to that Noble Lord for his Approbation and Assistance
to raise a publick Subscription for Reviving
Three Plays of the best Authors, with the full
Strength of the Company; every Subscriber to have
Three Tickets for the first Day of each Play for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
his single Payment of Three Guineas. This Subscription
his Lordship so zealously encouraged, that
from his Recommendation chiefly, in a very little
time it was compleated. The Plays were <i>Julius
C√¶sar</i> of <i>Shakespear</i>; the <i>King and no King</i> of
<i>Fletcher</i>, and the Comic Scenes of <i>Drydens Marriage
√† la mode</i> and of his <i>Maiden Queen</i> put together;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
for it was judg'd that, as these comic Episodes were
utterly independent of the serious Scenes they were
originally written to, they might on this occasion be
as well Episodes either to the other, and so make up
five livelier Acts between them: At least the Project
so well succeeded, that those comic Parts have never
since been replaced, but were continued to be jointly
acted as one Play several Years after.</p>

<p>By the Aid of this Subscription, which happen'd
in 1707, and by the additional Strength and Industry
of this Company, not only the Actors (several of
which were handsomely advanc'd in their Sallaries)
were duly paid, but the Menager himself, too, at the
Foot of his Account, stood a considerable Gainer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the Patentee of <i>Drury-Lane</i>
went on in his usual Method of paying extraordinary
Prices to Singers, Dancers, and other exotick Performers,
which were as constantly deducted out of
the sinking Sallaries of his Actors: 'Tis true his
Actors perhaps might not deserve much more than
he gave them; yet, by what I have related, it is
plain he chose not to be troubled with such as visibly
had deserv'd more: For it seems he had not purchas'd
his Share of the Patent to mend the Stage,
but to make Money of it: And to say Truth, his
Sense of every thing to be shewn there was much
upon a Level with the Taste of the Multitude, whose
Opinion and whose Money weigh'd with him full as
much as that of the best Judges. His Point was to
please the Majority, who could more easily comprehend
any thing they <i>saw</i> than the daintiest things
that could be said to them. But in this Notion he
kept no medium; for in my Memory he carry'd it so
far that he was (some few Years before this time)
actually dealing for an extraordinary large Elephant
at a certain Sum for every Day he might think fit
to shew the tractable Genius of that vast quiet
Creature in any Play or Farce in the Theatre (then
standing) in <i>Dorset-Garden</i>. But from the Jealousy
which so formidable a Rival had rais'd in his Dancers,
and by his Bricklayer's assuring him that if the
Walls were to be open'd wide enough for its Entrance
it might endanger the fall of the House, he gave up
his Project, and with it so hopeful a Prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
making the Receipts of the Stage run higher than all
the Wit and Force of the best Writers had ever yet
rais'd them to.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>About the same time of his being under this Disappointment
he put in Practice another Project of as
new, though not of so bold a Nature; which was his
introducing a Set of Rope-dancers into the same
Theatre; for the first Day of whose Performance he
had given out some Play in which I had a material
Part: But I was hardy enough to go into the Pit
and acquaint the Spectators near me, that I hop'd
they would not think it a Mark of my Disrespect to
them, if I declin'd acting upon any Stage that was
brought to so low a Disgrace as ours was like to be
by that Day's Entertainment. My Excuse was so
well taken that I never after found any ill Consequences,
or heard of the least Disapprobation of it:
And the whole Body of Actors, too, protesting
against such an Abuse of their Profession, our
cautious Master was too much alarm'd and intimidated
to repeat it.</p>

<p>After what I have said, it will be no wonder that
all due Regards to the original Use and Institution
of the Stage should be utterly lost or neglected: Nor
was the Conduct of this Menager easily to be alter'd
while he had found the Secret of making Money out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of Disorder and Confusion: For however strange it
may seem, I have often observ'd him inclin'd to be
cheerful in the Distresses of his Theatrical Affairs,
and equally reserv'd and pensive when they went
smoothly forward with a visible Profit. Upon a Run
of good Audiences he was more frighted to be
thought a Gainer, which might make him accountable
to others, than he was dejected with bad Houses,
which at worst he knew would make others accountable
to him: And as, upon a moderate Computation,
it cannot be supposed that the contested Accounts of
a twenty Year's Wear and Tear in a Play-house
could be fairly adjusted by a Master in Chancery
under four-score Years more, it will be no Surprize
that by the Neglect, or rather the Discretion, of other
Proprietors in not throwing away good Money after
bad, this Hero of a Menager, who alone supported
the War, should in time so fortify himself by Delay,
and so tire his Enemies, that he became sole
Monarch of his Theatrical Empire, and left the
quiet Possession of it to his Successors.</p>

<p>If these Facts seem too trivial for the Attention of
a sensible Reader, let it be consider'd that they are
not chosen Fictions to <i>entertain</i>, but Truths necessary
to <i>inform</i> him under what low Shifts and Disgraces,
what Disorders and Revolutions, the Stage
labour'd before it could recover that Strength and
Reputation wherewith it began to flourish towards
the latter End of Queen <i>Anne</i>'s Reign; and which
it continued to enjoy for a Course of twenty Years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
following. But let us resume our Account of the
new Settlement in the <i>Hay-Market</i>.</p>

<p>It may be a natural Question why the Actors
whom <i>Swiney</i> brought over to his Undertaking in
the <i>Hay-Market</i> would tie themselves down to
limited Sallaries? for though he as their Menager
was obliged to make them certain Payments, it was
not certain that the Receipts would enable him to do
it; and since their own Industry was the only visible
Fund they had to depend upon, why would they not
for that Reason insist upon their being Sharers as
well of possible Profits as Losses? How far in this
Point they acted right or wrong will appear from the
following State of their Case.</p>

<p>It must first be consider'd that this Scheme of their
Desertion was all concerted and put in Execution in a
Week's Time, which short Warning might make them
overlook that Circumstance, and the sudden Prospect
of being deliver'd from having seldom more than
half their Pay was a Contentment that had bounded
all their farther Views. Besides, as there could be
no room to doubt of their receiving their full Pay
previous to any Profits that might be reap'd by their
Labour, and as they had no great Reason to apprehend
those Profits could exceed their respective
Sallaries so far as to make them repine at them,
they might think it but reasonable to let the Chance
of any extraordinary Gain be on the Side of their
Leader and Director. But farther, as this Scheme
had the Approbation of the Court, these Actors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
reality had it not in their Power to alter any Part of
it: And what induced the Court to encourage it was,
that by having the Theatre and its Menager more
immediately dependent on the Power of the Lord
Chamberlain, it was not doubted but the Stage would
be recover'd into such a Reputation as might now
do Honour to that absolute Command which the
Court or its Officers seem'd always fond of having
over it.</p>

<p>Here, to set the Constitution of the Stage in a
clearer Light, it may not be amiss to look back a little
on the Power of a Lord Chamberlain, which, as may
have been observ'd in all Changes of the Theatrical
Government, has been the main Spring without
which no Scheme of what kind soever could be set
in Motion. My Intent is not to enquire how far by
Law this Power has been limited or extended; but
merely as an Historian to relate Facts to gratify the
Curious, and then leave them to their own Reflections:
This, too, I am the more inclin'd to, because there
is no one Circumstance which has affected the Stage
wherein so many Spectators, from those of the highest
Rank to the Vulgar, have seem'd more positively
knowing or less inform'd in.</p>

<p>Though in all the Letters Patent for acting Plays,
<i>&amp;c.</i> since King <i>Charles</i> the <i>First</i>'s Time there has
been no mention of the Lord Chamberlain, or of any
Subordination to his Command or Authority, yet it
was still taken for granted that no Letters Patent, by
the bare Omission of such a great Officer's Name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
could have superseded or taken out of his Hands
that Power which Time out of Mind he always had
exercised over the Theatre.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The common Opinions
then abroad were, that if the Profession of Actors
was unlawful, it was not in the Power of the Crown
to license it; and if it were not unlawful, it ought to
be free and independent as other Professions; and
that a Patent to exercise it was only an honorary
Favour from the Crown to give it a better Grace of
Recommendation to the Publick. But as the Truth
of this Question seem'd to be wrapt in a great deal
of Obscurity, in the old Laws made in former Reigns
relating to Players, <i>&amp;c.</i> it may be no Wonder that
the best Companies of Actors should be desirous of
taking Shelter under the visible Power of a Lord
Chamberlain who they knew had at his Pleasure
favoured and protected or born hard upon them:
But be all this as it may, a Lord Chamberlain (from
whencesoever his Power might be derived) had till
of later Years had always an implicit Obedience
paid to it: I shall now give some few Instances in
what manner it was exercised.</p>

<p>What appear'd to be most reasonably under his
Cognizance was the licensing or refusing new Plays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
or striking out what might be thought offensive in
them: Which Province had been for many Years
assign'd to his inferior Officer, the Master of the
Revels; yet was not this License irrevocable; for
several Plays, though acted by that Permission, had
been silenced afterwards. The first Instance of this
kind that common Fame has deliver'd down to us, is
that of the <i>Maid's Tragedy</i> of <i>Beaumont</i> and <i>Fletcher</i>,
which was forbid in King <i>Charles</i> the <i>Second</i>'s time,
by an Order from the Lord Chamberlain. For what
Reason this Interdiction was laid upon it the Politicks
of those Days have only left us to guess. Some
said that the killing of the King in that Play, while
the tragical Death of King <i>Charles</i> the <i>First</i> was
then so fresh in People's Memory, was an Object too
horribly impious for a publick Entertainment. What
makes this Conjecture seem to have some Foundation,
is that the celebrated <i>Waller</i>, in Compliment
to that Court, alter'd the last Act of this Play (which
is printed at the End of his Works) and gave it a
new Catastrophe, wherein the Life of the King is
loyally saved, and the Lady's Matter made up with
a less terrible Reparation. Others have given out,
that a repenting Mistress, in a romantick Revenge of
her Dishonour, killing the King in the very Bed he
expected her to come into, was shewing a too dangerous
Example to other <i>Evadnes</i> then shining at Court
in the same Rank of royal Distinction; who, if ever
their Consciences should have run equally mad,
might have had frequent Opportunities of putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the Expiation of their Frailty into the like Execution.
But this I doubt is too deep a Speculation, or
too ludicrous a Reason, to be relied on; it being well
known that the Ladies then in favour were not so
nice in their Notions as to think their Preferment
their Dishonour, or their Lover a Tyrant: Besides,
that easy Monarch loved his Roses without Thorns;
nor do we hear that he much chose to be himself the
first Gatherer of them.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Lucius Junius Brutus</i> of <i>Nat. Lee</i><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was in the
same Reign silenced after the third Day of Acting
it; it being objected that the Plan and Sentiments
of it had too boldly vindicated, and might enflame
republican Principles.</p>

<p>A Prologue (by <i>Dryden</i>) to the <i>Prophetess</i> was
forbid by the Lord <i>Dorset</i> after the first Day of its
being spoken.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This happen'd when King <i>William</i>
was prosecuting the War in <i>Ireland</i>. It must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
confess'd that this Prologue had some familiar, metaphorical
Sneers at the Revolution itself; and as the
Poetry of it was good, the Offence of it was less
pardonable.</p>

<p>The Tragedy of <i>Mary</i> Queen of <i>Scotland</i><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> had
been offer'd to the Stage twenty Years before it was
acted: But from the profound Penetration of the
Master of the Revels, who saw political Spectres in it
that never appear'd in the Presentation, it had lain
so long upon the Hands of the Author; who had at
last the good Fortune to prevail with a Nobleman to
favour his Petition to Queen <i>Anne</i> for Permission to
have it acted: The Queen had the Goodness to refer
the Merit of his Play to the Opinion of that noble
Person, although he was not her Majesty's Lord Chamberlain;
upon whose Report of its being every way
an innocent Piece, it was soon after acted with Success.</p>

<p>Reader, by your Leave&mdash;&mdash;I will but just speak
a Word or two to any Author that has not yet writ
one Line of his next Play, and then I will come to
my Point again&mdash;&mdash;What I would say to him is this&mdash;Sir,
before you set Pen to Paper, think well and
principally of your Design or chief Action, towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
which every Line you write ought to be drawn, as to
its Centre: If we can say of your finest Sentiments,
This or That might be left out without maiming the
Story, you would tell us, depend upon it, that fine
thing is said in a wrong Place; and though you may
urge that a bright Thought is not to be resisted, you
will not be able to deny that those very fine Lines
would be much finer if you could find a proper Occasion
for them: Otherwise you will be thought to take
less Advice from <i>Aristotle</i> or <i>Horace</i> than from Poet
<i>Bays</i> in the <i>Rehearsal</i>, who very smartly says&mdash;<i>What
the Devil is the Plot good for but to bring in fine
things?</i> Compliment the Taste of your Hearers as
much as you please with them, provided they belong
to your Subject, but don't, like a dainty Preacher who
has his Eye more upon this World than the next,
leave your Text for them. When your Fable is
good, every Part of it will cost you much less Labour
to keep your Narration alive, than you will be forced
to bestow upon those elegant Discourses that are not
absolutely conducive to your Catastrophe or main
Purpose: Scenes of that kind shew but at best the
unprofitable or injudicious Spirit of a Genius. It is
but a melancholy Commendation of a fine Thought
to say, when we have heard it, <i>Well! but what's all
this to the Purpose?</i> Take, therefore, in some part,
Example by the Author last mention'd! There are
three Plays of his, The <i>Earl</i> of <i>Essex</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> <i>Anna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Bullen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i>, which, tho' they
are all written in the most barren, barbarous Stile that
was ever able to keep Possession of the Stage, have all
interested the Hearts of his Auditors. To what then
could this Success be owing, but to the intrinsick
and naked Value of the well-conducted Tales he has
simply told us? There is something so happy in the
Disposition of all his Fables; all his chief Characters
are thrown into such natural Circumstances of Distress,
that their Misery or Affliction wants very little
Assistance from the Ornaments of Stile or Words to
speak them. When a skilful Actor is so situated,
his bare plaintive Tone of Voice, the Cast of Sorrow
from his Eye, his slowly graceful Gesture, his humble
Sighs of Resignation under his Calamities: All these,
I say, are sometimes without a Tongue equal to the
strongest Eloquence. At such a time the attentive
Auditor supplies from his own Heart whatever the
Poet's Language may fall short of in Expression, and
melts himself into every Pang of Humanity which
the like Misfortunes in real Life could have inspir'd.</p>

<p>After what I have observ'd, whenever I see a
Tragedy defective in its Fable, let there be never so
many fine Lines in it; I hope I shall be forgiven if
I impute that Defect to the Idleness, the weak Judgment,
or barren Invention of the Author.</p>

<p>If I should be ask'd why I have not always my
self follow'd the Rules I would impose upon others;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
I can only answer, that whenever I have not, I lie
equally open to the same critical Censure. But
having often observ'd a better than ordinary Stile
thrown away upon the loose and wandering Scenes
of an ill-chosen Story, I imagin'd these Observations
might convince some future Author of how great
Advantage a Fable well plann'd must be to a Man
of any tolerable Genius.</p>

<p>All this I own is leading my Reader out of the
way; but if he has as much Time upon his Hands
as I have, (provided we are neither of us tir'd) it
may be equally to the Purpose what he reads or
what I write of. But as I have no Objection to
Method when it is not troublesome, I return to my
Subject.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have seen no very unreasonable Instance
of this absolute Power of a Lord Chamberlain,
though we were to admit that no one knew of any
real Law, or Construction of Law, by which this
Power was given him. I shall now offer some Facts
relating to it of a more extraordinary Nature, which
I leave my Reader to give a Name to.</p>

<p>About the middle of King <i>William</i>'s Reign an
Order of the Lord Chamberlain was then subsisting
that no Actor of either Company should presume to
go from one to the other without a Discharge from
their respective Menagers<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the Permission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the Lord Chamberlain. Notwithstanding such Order,
<i>Powel</i>, being uneasy at the Favour <i>Wilks</i> was then
rising into, had without such Discharge left the <i>Drury-Lane</i>
Theatre and engag'd himself to that of <i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</i>:
But by what follows it will appear that
this Order was not so much intended to do both of
them <i>good</i>, as to do that which the Court chiefly
favour'd (<i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</i>) no harm.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> For when
<i>Powel</i> grew dissatisfy'd at his Station there too, he
return'd to <i>Drury-Lane</i> (as he had before gone from
it) without a Discharge: But halt a little! here, on
this Side of the Question, the Order was to stand in
force, and the same Offence against it now was not to
be equally pass'd over. He was the next Day taken
up by a Messenger and confin'd to the Porter's-Lodge,
where, to the best of my Remembrance, he
remain'd about two Days; when the Menagers of
<i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</i>, not thinking an Actor of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
loose Character worth their farther Trouble, gave him
up; though perhaps he was releas'd for some better
Reason.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Upon this occasion, the next Day, behind
the Scenes at <i>Drury-Lane</i>, a Person of great Quality
in my hearing enquiring of <i>Powel</i> into the Nature
of his Offence, after he had heard it, told him, That
if he had had Patience or Spirit enough to have
staid in his Confinement till he had given him Notice
of it, he would have found him a handsomer way of
coming out of it.</p>

<p>Another time the same Actor, <i>Powel</i>, was provok'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
at <i>Will</i>'s Coffee-house, in a Dispute about the Playhouse
Affairs, to strike a Gentleman whose Family
had been sometimes Masters of it; a Complaint of
this Insolence was, in the Absence of the Lord-Chamberlain,
immediately made to the Vice-Chamberlain,
who so highly resented it that he thought himself
bound in Honour to carry his Power of redressing
it as far as it could possibly go: For <i>Powel</i> having
a Part in the Play that was acted the Day after, the
Vice-Chamberlain sent an Order to silence the whole
Company for having suffer'd <i>Powel</i> to appear upon
the Stage before he had made that Gentleman Satisfaction,
although the Masters of the Theatre had
had no Notice of <i>Powel</i>'s Misbehaviour: However,
this Order was obey'd, and remain'd in force for two
or three Days, 'till the same Authority was pleas'd
or advis'd to revoke it.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> From the Measures this
injur'd Gentleman took for his Redress, it may be
judg'd how far it was taken for granted that a
Lord-Chamberlain had an absolute Power over the
Theatre.</p>

<p>I shall now give an Instance of an Actor who had
the Resolution to stand upon the Defence of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Liberty against the same Authority, and was reliev'd
by it.</p>

<p>In the same King's Reign, <i>Dogget</i>, who tho', from
a severe Exactness in his Nature, he could be seldom
long easy in any Theatre, where Irregularity, not to
say Injustice, too often prevail'd, yet in the private
Conduct of his Affairs he was a prudent, honest Man.
He therefore took an unusual Care, when he return'd
to act under the Patent in <i>Drury-Lane</i>, to have his
Articles drawn firm and binding: But having some
Reason to think the Patentee had not dealt fairly
with him, he quitted the Stage and would act no
more, rather chusing to lose his whatever unsatisfy'd
Demands than go through the chargeable and tedious
Course of the Law to recover it. But the Patentee,
who (from other People's Judgment) knew the Value
of him, and who wanted, too, to have him sooner back
than the Law could possibly bring him, thought the
surer way would be to desire a shorter Redress from
the Authority of the Lord-Chamberlain.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Accordingly,
upon his Complaint a Messenger was immediately
dispatch'd to <i>Norwich</i>, where <i>Dogget</i> then was,
to bring him up in Custody: But doughty <i>Dogget</i>,
who had Money in his Pocket and the Cause of
Liberty at his Heart, was not in the least intimidated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
by this formidable Summons. He was observ'd to
obey it with a particular Chearfulness, entertaining
his Fellow-traveller, the Messenger, all the way in
the Coach (for he had protested against Riding)
with as much Humour as a Man of his Business
might be capable of tasting. And as he found his
Charges were to be defray'd, he, at every Inn, call'd
for the best Dainties the Country could afford or a
pretended weak Appetite could digest. At this rate
they jollily roll'd on, more with the Air of a Jaunt
than a Journey, or a Party of Pleasure than of a
poor Devil in Durance. Upon his Arrival in Town
he immediately apply'd to the Lord Chief Justice
<i>Holt</i> for his <i>Habeas Corpus</i>. As his Case was something
particular, that eminent and learned Minister
of the Law took a particular Notice of it: For
<i>Dogget</i> was not only discharg'd, but the Process of
his Confinement (according to common Fame) had a
Censure pass'd upon it in Court, which I doubt I
am not Lawyer enough to repeat! To conclude, the
officious Agents in this Affair, finding that in <i>Dogget</i>
they had mistaken their Man, were mollify'd into
milder Proceedings, and (as he afterwards told me)
whisper'd something in his Ear that took away
<i>Dogget</i>'s farther Uneasiness about it.</p>

<p>By these Instances we see how naturally Power
only founded on Custom is apt, where the Law is
silent, to run into Excesses, and while it laudably
pretends to govern others, how hard it is to govern
itself.  But since the Law has lately open'd its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Mouth, and has said plainly that some Part of this
Power to govern the Theatre shall be, and is plac'd
in a proper Person; and as it is evident that the
Power of that white Staff, ever since it has been in
the noble Hand that now holds it, has been us'd with
the utmost Lenity, I would beg leave of the murmuring
Multitude who frequent the Theatre to offer
them a simple Question or two, <i>viz.</i> Pray, Gentlemen,
how came you, or rather your Fore-fathers, never to
be mutinous upon any of the occasional Facts I have
related? And why have you been so often tumultuous
upon a Law's being made that only confirms a
less Power than was formerly exercis'd without any
Law to support it? You cannot, sure, say such Discontent
is either just or natural, unless you allow it a
Maxim in your Politicks that Power exercis'd <i>without</i>
Law is a less Grievance than the same Power exercis'd
<i>according</i> to Law!</p>

<p>Having thus given the clearest View I was able
of the usual Regard paid to the Power of a Lord-Chamberlain,
the Reader will more easily conceive
what Influence and Operation that Power must
naturally have in all Theatrical Revolutions, and particularly
in the complete Re-union of both Companies,
which happen'd in the Year following.</p>

<div class="chapquot">

<p><i>Some Chim√¶rical Thoughts of making the Stage useful: Some, to its
Reputation. The Patent unprofitable to all the Proprietors but
one. A fourth Part of it given away to Colonel</i> Brett. <i>A

<p>From the Time that the Company of Actors in

Director, <i>Swiney</i>, the Theatre for three or four Years
following suffer'd so many Convulsions, and was
thrown every other Winter under such different
Interests and Menagement before it came to a firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and lasting Settlement, that I am doubtful if the
most candid Reader will have Patience to go
through a full and fair Account of it: And yet I
would fain flatter my self that those who are not
too wise to frequent the Theatre (or have Wit
enough to distinguish what sort of Sights there either
do Honour or Disgrace to it) may think their national
Diversion no contemptible Subject for a more able
Historian than I pretend to be: If I have any particular
Qualification for the Task more than another
it is that I have been an ocular Witness of the
several Facts that are to fill up the rest of my
Volume, and am perhaps the only Person living

can be collected; but let them come from whom they
may, whether at best they will be worth reading,
perhaps a Judgment may be better form'd after a
patient Perusal of the following Digression.</p>

<p>In whatever cold Esteem the Stage may be among
the Wise and Powerful, it is not so much a Reproach
to those who contentedly enjoy it in its lowest Condition,
as that Condition of it is to those who (though
they cannot but know to how valuable a publick
Use a Theatre, well establish'd, might be rais'd) yet
in so many civiliz'd Nations have neglected it. This
perhaps will be call'd thinking my own wiser than
all the wise Heads in <i>Europe</i>. But I hope a more
humble Sense will be given to it; at least I only
mean, that if so many Governments have their
Reasons for their Disregard of their Theatres, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Reasons may be deeper than my Capacity has yet
been able to dive into: If therefore my simple
Opinion is a wrong one, let the Singularity of it
expose me: And tho' I am only building a Theatre
in the Air, it is there, however, at so little Expence
and in so much better a Taste than any I have yet
seen, that I cannot help saying of it, as a wiser Man
did (it may be) upon a wiser Occasion:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Give me leave to play with my Project in Fancy.</p>

<p>I say, then, that as I allow nothing is more liable
to debase and corrupt the Minds of a People than a
licentious Theatre, so under a just and proper Establishment
it were possible to make it as apparently
the School of Manners and of Virtue. Were I to
collect all the Arguments that might be given for
my Opinion, or to inforce it by exemplary Proofs, it
might swell this short Digression to a Volume; I
shall therefore trust the Validity of what I have laid
down to a single Fact that may be still fresh in the
Memory of many living Spectators. When the
Tragedy of <i>Cato</i> was first acted,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> let us call to mind
the noble Spirit of Patriotism which that Play then
infus'd into the Breasts of a free People that crowded
to it; with what affecting Force was that most
elevated of Human Virtues recommended? Even
the false Pretenders to it felt an unwilling Conviction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and made it a Point of Honour to be foremost in
their Approbation; and this, too, at a time when
the fermented Nation had their different Views of
Government. Yet the sublime Sentiments of Liberty
in that venerable Character rais'd in every sensible
Hearer such conscious Admiration, such compell'd
Assent to the Conduct of a suffering Virtue, as even
<i>demanded</i> two almost irreconcileable Parties to embrace
and join in their equal Applauses of it.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Now,
not to take from the Merit of the Writer, had that
Play never come to the Stage, how much of this
valuable Effect of it must have been lost? It then
could have had no more immediate weight with the
Publick than our poring upon the many ancient
Authors thro' whose Works the same Sentiments
have been perhaps less profitably dispers'd, tho'
amongst Millions of Readers; but by bringing such
Sentiments to the Theatre and into Action, what a
superior Lustre did they shine with? There <i>Cato</i>
breath'd again in Life; and though he perish'd in
the Cause of Liberty, his Virtue was victorious, and
left the Triumph of it in the Heart of every melting
Spectator. If Effects like these are laudable, if the
Representation of such Plays can carry Conviction
with so much Pleasure to the Understanding, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
they not vastly the Advantage of any other Human
Helps to Eloquence? What equal Method can be
found to lead or stimulate the Mind to a quicker
Sense of Truth and Virtue, or warm a People into
the Love and Practice of such Principles as might
be at once a Defence and Honour to their Country?
In what Shape could we listen to Virtue with equal
Delight or Appetite of Instruction? The Mind of
Man is naturally free, and when he is compell'd or
menac'd into any Opinion that he does not readily
conceive, he is more apt to doubt the Truth of it
than when his Capacity is led by Delight into Evidence
and Reason. To preserve a Theatre in this
Strength and Purity of Morals is, I grant, what the
wisest Nations have not been able to perpetuate or
to transmit long to their Posterity: But this Difficulty
will rather heighten than take from the Honour of
the Theatre: The greatest Empires have decay'd
for want of proper Heads to guide them, and the
Ruins of them sometimes have been the Subject of
Theatres that could not be themselves exempt from
as various Revolutions: Yet may not the most
natural Inference from all this be, That the Talents
requisite to form good Actors, great Writers, and
true Judges were, like those of wise and memorable
Ministers, as well the Gifts of Fortune as of Nature,
and not always to be found in all Climes or Ages.
Or can there be a stronger modern Evidence of
the Value of Dramatick Performances than that in
many Countries where the Papal Religion prevails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the Holy Policy (though it allows not to an Actor
Christian Burial) is so conscious of the Usefulness
of his Art that it will frequently take in the Assistance
of the Theatre to give even Sacred History, in
a Tragedy, a Recommendation to the more pathetick
Regard of their People. How can such Principles,
in the Face of the World, refuse the Bones of a
Wretch the lowest Benefit of Christian Charity after
having admitted his Profession (for which they deprive
him of that Charity) to serve the solemn Purposes
of Religion? How far then is this Religious
Inhumanity short of that famous Painter's, who, to
make his <i>Crucifix</i> a Master-piece of Nature, stabb'd
the Innocent Hireling from whose Body he drew it;
and having heighten'd the holy Portrait with his last
Agonies of Life, then sent it to be the consecrated
Ornament of an Altar? Though we have only the
Authority of common Fame for this Story, yet be it
true or false the Comparison will still be just. Or
let me ask another Question more humanly political.</p>

<p>How came the <i>Athenians</i> to lay out an Hundred
Thousand Pounds upon the Decorations of one single
Tragedy of <i>Sophocles</i>?<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Not, sure, as it was merely
a Spectacle for Idleness or Vacancy of Thought to
gape at, but because it was the most rational, most
instructive and delightful Composition that Human
Wit had yet arrived at, and consequently the most
worthy to be the Entertainment of a wise and warlike
Nation: And it may be still a Question whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the <i>Sophocles</i> inspir'd this Publick Spirit, or this
Publick Spirit inspir'd the <i>Sophocles</i>?<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>But alas! as the Power of giving or receiving such
Inspirations from either of these Causes seems pretty
well at an End, now I have shot my Bolt I shall
descend to talk more like a Man of the Age I live
in: For, indeed, what is all this to a common <i>English</i>
Reader? Why truly, as <i>Shakespear</i> terms it&mdash;<i>Caviare
to the Multitude!</i><a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Honest <i>John Trott</i> will
tell you, that if he were to believe what I have said
of the <i>Athenians</i>, he is at most but astonish'd at it;
but that if the twentieth Part of the Sum I have
mentioned were to be apply'd out of the Publick
money to the Setting off the best Tragedy the nicest
Noddle in the Nation could produce, it would probably
raise the Passions higher in those that did Not
like it than in those that did; it might as likely
meet with an Insurrection as the Applause of the
People, and so, mayhap, be fitter for the Subject of
a Tragedy than for a publick Fund to support it.&mdash;&mdash;Truly,
Mr. <i>Trott</i>, I cannot but own that I am
very much of your Opinion: I am only concerned
that the Theatre has not a better Pretence to the
Care and further Consideration of those Governments
where it is tolerated; but as what I have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
will not probably do it any great Harm, I hope I
have not put you out of Patience by throwing a few
good Wishes after an old Acquaintance.</p>

<p>To conclude this Digression. If for the Support
of the Stage what is generally shewn there must be
lower'd to the Taste of common Spectators; or if it
is inconsistent with Liberty to mend that Vulgar
Taste by making the Multitude less merry there; or
by abolishing every low and senseless Jollity in
which the Understanding can have no Share; whenever,
I say, such is the State of the Stage, it will be
as often liable to unanswerable Censure and manifest
Disgraces. Yet there <i>was</i> a Time, not yet out of
many People's Memory, when it subsisted upon its
own rational Labours; when even Success attended
an Attempt to reduce it to Decency; and when
Actors themselves were hardy enough to hazard
their Interest in pursuit of so dangerous a Reformation.
And this Crisis I am my self as impatient as
any tir'd Reader can be to arrive at. I shall therefore
endeavour to lead him the shortest way to it.
But as I am a little jealous of the badness of the
Road, I must reserve to myself the Liberty of calling
upon any Matter in my way, for a little Refreshment
to whatever Company may have the Curiosity or
Goodness to go along with me.</p>

<p>When the sole Menaging Patentee at <i>Drury-Lane</i>
for several Years could never be persuaded or driven
to any Account with the Adventurers, Sir <i>Thomas
Skipwith</i> (who, if I am rightly inform'd, had an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Share with him<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>) grew so weary of the Affair that
he actually made a Present of his entire Interest in
it upon the following Occasion.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Thomas</i> happen'd in the Summer preceding
the Re-union of the Companies to make a Visit to
an intimate Friend of his, Colonel <i>Brett</i>, of <i>Sandywell</i>,
in <i>Gloucestershire</i>; where the Pleasantness of
the Place, and the agreeable manner of passing his
Time there, had raised him to such a Gallantry of
Heart, that in return to the Civilities of his Friend
the Colonel he made him an Offer of his whole
Right in the Patent; but not to overrate the Value
of his Present, told him he himself had made nothing
of it these ten Years: But the Colonel (he said)
being a greater Favourite of the People in Power,
and (as he believ'd) among the Actors too, than himself
was, might think of some Scheme to turn it to
Advantage, and in that Light, if he lik'd it, it was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
his Service. After a great deal of Raillery on both
sides of what Sir <i>Thomas</i> had <i>not</i> made of it, and the
particular Advantages the Colonel was likely to make
of it, they came to a laughing Resolution That an
Instrument should be drawn the next Morning of an
Absolute Conveyance of the Premises. A Gentleman
of the Law well known to them both happening
to be a Guest there at the same time, the next
Day produced the Deed according to his Instructions,
in the Presence of whom and of others it was
sign'd, seal'd, and deliver'd to the Purposes therein
contain'd.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>This Transaction may be another Instance (as I
have elsewhere observed) at how low a Value the
Interests in a Theatrical License were then held,
tho' it was visible from the Success of <i>Swiney</i> in that
very Year that with tolerable Menagement they
could at no time have fail'd of being a profitable
Purchase.</p>

<p>The next Thing to be consider'd was what the
Colonel should do with his new Theatrical Commission,
which in another's Possession had been of so
little Importance. Here it may be necessary to premise
that this Gentleman was the first of any Consideration
since my coming to the Stage with whom
I had contracted a Personal Intimacy; which might
be the Reason why in this Debate my Opinion had
some Weight with him: Of this Intimacy, too, I am
the more tempted to talk from the natural Pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of calling back in Age the Pursuits and happy
Ardours of Youth long past, which, like the Ideas
of a delightful Spring in a Winter's Rumination,
are sometimes equal to the former Enjoyment of
them. I shall, therefore, rather chuse in this Place
to gratify my self than my Reader, by setting the
fairest Side of this Gentleman in view, and by indulging
a little conscious Vanity in shewing how early in
Life I fell into the Possession of so agreeable a Companion:
Whatever Failings he might have to others,
he had none to me; nor was he, where he had them,
without his valuable Qualities to balance or soften
them. Let, then, what was not to be commended in
him rest with his Ashes, never to be rak'd into: But
the friendly Favours I received from him while
living give me still a Pleasure in paying this only
Mite of my Acknowledgment in my Power to his
Memory. And if my taking this Liberty may find
Pardon from several of his fair Relations still living,
for whom I profess the utmost Respect, it will give
me but little Concern tho' my critical Readers should
think it all Impertinence.</p>

<p>This Gentleman, then, <i>Henry</i>, was the eldest Son
of <i>Henry Brett</i>, Esq; of <i>Cowley</i>, in <i>Gloucestershire</i>,
who coming early to his Estate of about Two Thousand
a Year, by the usual Negligences of young
Heirs had, before this his eldest Son came of age,
sunk it to about half that Value, and that not wholly
free from Incumbrances. Mr. <i>Brett</i>, whom I am
speaking of, had his Education, and I might say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
ended it, at the University of <i>Oxford</i>; for tho' he
was settled some time after at the <i>Temple</i>, he so little
followed the Law there that his Neglect of it made
the Law (like some of his fair and frail Admirers)
very often follow <i>him</i>. As he had an uncommon
Share of Social Wit and a handsom Person, with a
sanguine Bloom in his Complexion, no wonder they
persuaded him that he might have a better Chance
of Fortune by throwing such Accomplishments into
the gayer World than by shutting them up in a
Study. The first View that fires the Head of a
young Gentleman of this modish Ambition just
broke loose from Business, is to cut a Figure (as they
call it) in a Side-box at the Play, from whence their
next Step is to the <i>Green Room</i> behind the Scenes,
sometimes their <i>Non ultra</i>. Hither at last, then, in
this hopeful Quest of his Fortune, came this Gentleman-Errant,
not doubting but the fickle Dame, while
he was thus qualified to receive her, might be tempted
to fall into his Lap. And though possibly the
Charms of our Theatrical Nymphs might have their
Share in drawing him thither, yet in my Observation
the most visible Cause of his first coming was a
more sincere Passion he had conceived for a fair full-bottom'd
Perriwig which I then wore in my first Play
of the <i>Fool in Fashion</i> in the Year 1695.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> For it is
to be noted that the <i>Beaux</i> of those Days were of a
quite different Cast from the modern Stamp, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
more of the Stateliness of the Peacock in their Mien
than (which now seems to be their highest Emulation)
the pert Air of a Lapwing. Now, whatever
Contempt Philosophers may have for a fine Perriwig,
my Friend, who was not to despise the World, but
to live in it, knew very well that so material an
Article of Dress upon the Head of a Man of Sense,
if it became him, could never fail of drawing to him
a more partial Regard and Benevolence than could
possibly be hoped for in an ill-made one.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This perhaps
may soften the grave Censure which so youthful
a Purchase might otherwise have laid upon him:
In a Word, he made his Attack upon this Perriwig,
as your young Fellows generally do upon a Lady of
Pleasure, first by a few familiar Praises of her Person,
and then a civil Enquiry into the Price of it. But
upon his observing me a little surprized at the Levity
of his Question about a Fop's Perriwig, he began to
railly himself with so much Wit and Humour upon
the Folly of his Fondness for it, that he struck me
with an equal Desire of granting any thing in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Power to oblige so facetious a Customer. This
singular Beginning of our Conversation, and the
mutual Laughs that ensued upon it, ended in an
Agreement to finish our Bargain that Night over a
Bottle.</p>

<p>If it were possible the Relation of the happy Indiscretions
which passed between us that Night could
give the tenth Part of the Pleasure I then received
from them, I could still repeat them with Delight:
But as it may be doubtful whether the Patience of a
Reader may be quite so strong as the Vanity of an
Author, I shall cut it short by only saying that single
Bottle was the Sire of many a jolly Dozen that for
some Years following, like orderly Children, whenever
they were call'd for, came into the same Company.
Nor, indeed, did I think from that time,
whenever he was to be had, any Evening could
be agreeably enjoy'd without him.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But the long
continuance of our Intimacy perhaps may be thus
accounted for.</p>

<p>He who can taste Wit in another may in some
sort be said to have it himself: Now, as I always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
had, and (I bless my self for the Folly) still have a
quick Relish of whatever did or can give me Delight:
This Gentleman could not but see the youthful Joy
I was generally raised to whenever I had the Happiness
of a <i>T√™te √† t√™te</i> with him; and it may be a
moot Point whether Wit is not as often inspired by a
proper Attention as by the brightest Reply to it.
Therefore, as he had Wit enough for any two People,
and I had Attention enough for any four, there could
not well be wanting a sociable Delight on either side.
And tho' it may be true that a Man of a handsome
Person is apt to draw a partial Ear to every thing
he says; yet this Gentleman seldom said any thing
that might not have made a Man of the plainest
Person agreeable. Such a continual Desire to please,
it may be imagined, could not but sometimes lead
him into a little venial Flattery rather than not
succeed in it. And I, perhaps, might be one of
those Flies that was caught in this Honey. As I
was then a young successful Author and an Actor
in some unexpected Favour, whether deservedly or
not imports not; yet such Appearances at least were
plausible Pretences enough for an amicable Adulation
to enlarge upon, and the Sallies of it a less
Vanity than mine might not have been able to resist.
Whatever this Weakness on my side might be, I was
not alone in it; for I have heard a Gentleman of
Condition say, who knew the World as well as most
Men that live in it, that let his Discretion be ever
so much upon its Guard, he never fell into Mr. <i>Brett</i>'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Company without being loth to leave it or carrying
away a better Opinion of himself from it. If his
Conversation had this Effect among the Men; what
must we suppose to have been the Consequence
when he gave it a yet softer turn among the Fair
Sex? Here, now, a <i>French</i> Novellist would tell you
fifty pretty Lies of him; but as I chuse to be tender
of Secrets of that sort, I shall only borrow the good
Breeding of that Language, and tell you in a Word,
that I knew several Instances of his being <i>un
Homme √† bonne Fortune</i>. But though his frequent
Successes might generally keep him from the usual
Disquiets of a Lover, he knew this was a Life too
liquorish to last; and therefore had Reflexion enough
to be govern'd by the Advice of his Friends to turn
these his Advantages of Nature to a better use.</p>

<p>Among the many Men of Condition with whom
his Conversation had recommended him to an Intimacy,
Sir <i>Thomas Skipwith</i> had taken a particular
Inclination to him; and as he had the Advancement
of his Fortune at Heart, introduced him where there
was a Lady<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> who had enough in her Power to disencumber
him of the World and make him every
way easy for Life.</p>

<p>While he was in pursuit of this Affair, which no
time was to be lost in (for the Lady was to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Town but for three Weeks) I one Day found him
idling behind the Scenes before the Play was begun.
Upon sight of him I took the usual Freedom he
allow'd me, to rate him roundly for the Madness of
not improving every Moment in his Power in what
was of such consequence to him. Why are you not
(said I) where you know you only should be? If
your Design should once get Wind in the Town,
the Ill-will of your Enemies or the Sincerity of
the Lady's Friends may soon blow up your Hopes,
which in your Circumstances of Life cannot be long
supported by the bare Appearance of a Gentleman.&mdash;&mdash;But
it is impossible to proceed without some
Apology for the very familiar Circumstance that is
to follow&mdash;&mdash;Yet, as it might not be so trivial in its
Effect as I fear it may be in the Narration, and is a
Mark of that Intimacy which is necessary should be
known had been between us, I will honestly make
bold with my Scruples and let the plain Truth of my
Story take its Chance for Contempt or Approbation.</p>

<p>After twenty Excuses to clear himself of the
Neglect I had so warmly charged him with, he concluded
them with telling me he had been out all the
Morning upon Business, and that his Linnen was too
much soil'd to be seen in Company. Oh, ho! said
I, is that all? Come along with me, we will soon get
over that dainty Difficulty: Upon which I haul'd
him by the Sleeve into my Shifting-Room, he either
staring, laughing, or hanging back all the way.
There, when I had lock'd him in, I began to strip off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
my upper Cloaths, and bad him do the same; still he
either did not, or would not seem to understand me,
and continuing his Laugh, cry'd, What! is the Puppy
mad? No, no, only positive, said I; for look you,
in short, the Play is ready to begin, and the Parts
that you and I are to act to Day are not of equal
consequence; mine of young <i>Reveller</i> (in <i>Greenwich-Park</i><a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>)
is but a Rake; but whatever you may be,
you are not to appear so; therefore take my Shirt
and give me yours; for depend upon't, stay here you
shall not, and so go about your Business. To conclude,
we fairly chang'd Linnen, nor could his
Mother's have wrap'd him up more fortunately; for
in about ten Days he marry'd the Lady.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In a
Year or two after his Marriage he was chosen a
Member of that Parliament which was sitting when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
King <i>William</i> dy'd. And, upon raising of some
new Regiments, was made Lieutenant-Colonel to
that of Sir <i>Charles Hotham</i>. But as his Ambition
extended not beyond the Bounds of a Park Wall
and a pleasant Retreat in the Corner of it, which
with too much Expence he had just finish'd, he,
within another Year, had leave to resign his Company
to a younger Brother.</p>

<p>This was the Figure in Life he made when Sir
<i>Thomas Skipwith</i> thought him the most proper Person
to oblige (if it could be an Obligation) with the
Present of his Interest in the Patent. And from
these Anecdotes of my Intimacy with him, it may be
less a Surprise, when he came to Town invested with
this new Theatrical Power, that I should be the first
Person to whom he took any Notice of it. And
notwithstanding he knew I was then engag'd, in
another Interest, at the <i>Hay-Market</i>, he desired we
might consider together of the best Use he could
make of it, assuring me at the same time he should
think it of none to himself unless it could in some
Shape be turn'd to my Advantage. This friendly
Declaration, though it might be generous in him to
make, was not needful to incline me in whatever
might be honestly in my Power, whether by Interest
or Negotiation, to serve him.  My first Advice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
therefore, was, That he should produce his Deed to
the other Menaging Patentee of <i>Drury-Lane</i>, and
demand immediate Entrance to a joint Possession of
all Effects and Powers to which that Deed had given
him an equal Title. After which, if he met with no
Opposition to this Demand (as upon sight of it he
did not) that he should be watchful against any Contradiction
from his Collegue in whatever he might
propose in carrying on the Affair, but to let him see
that he was determin'd in all his Measures. Yet to
heighten that Resolution with an Ease and Temper
in his manner, as if he took it for granted there could
be no Opposition made to whatever he had a mind
to. For that this Method, added to his natural
Talent of Persuading, would imperceptibly lead his
Collegue into a Reliance on his superior Understanding,
That however little he car'd for Business
he should give himself the Air at least of Enquiry
into what <i>had</i> been done, that what he intended to
do might be thought more considerable and be the
readier comply'd with: For if he once suffer'd his
Collegue to seem wiser than himself, there would be
no end of his perplexing him with absurd and dilatory
Measures; direct and plain Dealing being a Quality
his natural Diffidence would never suffer him to be
Master of; of which his not complying with his
Verbal Agreement with <i>Swiney</i>, when the <i>Hay-Market</i>
House was taken for both their Uses, was
an Evidence. And though some People thought
it Depth and Policy in him to keep things often in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Confusion, it was ever my Opinion they over-rated
his Skill, and that, in reality, his Parts were too weak
for his Post, in which he had always acted to the
best of his Knowledge. That his late Collegue, Sir
<i>Thomas Skipwith</i>, had trusted too much to his
Capacity for this sort of Business, and was treated
by him accordingly, without ever receiving any Profits
from it for several Years: Insomuch that when he
found his Interest in such desperate Hands he
thought the best thing he could do with it was (as
he saw) to give it away. Therefore if he (Mr. <i>Brett</i>)
could once fix himself, as I had advis'd, upon a different
Foot with this hitherto untractable Menager,
the Business would soon run through whatever
Channel he might have a mind to lead it. And
though I allow'd the greatest Difficulty he would
meet with would be in getting his Consent to a
Union of the two Companies, which was the only
Scheme that could raise the Patent to its former
Value, and which I knew this close Menager would
secretly lay all possible Rubs in the way to; yet it
was visible there was a way of reducing him to Compliance:
For though it was true his Caution would
never part with a Straw by way of Concession, yet
to a high Hand he would give up any thing, provided
he were suffer'd to keep his Title to it: If his
Hat were taken from his Head in the Street, he
would make no farther Resistance than to say, I <i>am
not willing to part with it</i>. Much less would he
have the Resolution openly to oppose any just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Measures, when he should find one, who with an
equal Right to his and with a known Interest to
bring them about, was resolv'd to go thro' with them.</p>

<p>Now though I knew my Friend was as thoroughly
acquainted with this Patentee's Temper as myself,
yet I thought it not amiss to quicken and support
his Resolution, by confirming to him the little Trouble
he would meet with, in pursuit of the Union I had
advis'd him to; for it must be known that on our
side Trouble was a sort of Physick we did not much
care to take: But as the Fatigue of this Affair was
likely to be lower'd by a good deal of Entertainment
and Humour, which would naturally engage him in
his dealing with so exotick a Partner, I knew that
this softening the Business into a Diversion would
lessen every Difficulty that lay in our way to it.</p>

<p>However copiously I may have indulg'd my self
in this Commemoration of a Gentleman with whom
I had pass'd so many of my younger Days with
Pleasure, yet the Reader may by this Insight into
his Character, and by that of the other Patentee, be
better able to judge of the secret Springs that gave
Motion to or obstructed so considerable an Event as
that of the Re-union of the two Companies of Actors
in 1708.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In Histories of more weight, for want of
such Particulars we are often deceiv'd in the true
Causes of Facts that most concern us to be let into;
which sometimes makes us ascribe to Policy, or false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Appearances of Wisdom, what perhaps in reality
was the mere Effect of Chance or Humour.</p>

<p>Immediately after Mr. <i>Brett</i> was admitted as a
joint Patentee, he made use of the Intimacy he had
with the Vice-Chamberlain to assist his Scheme of
this intended Union, in which he so far prevail'd
that it was soon after left to the particular Care of
the same Vice-Chamberlain to give him all the Aid
and Power necessary to the bringing what he desired
to Perfection. The Scheme was, to have but one
Theatre for Plays and another for Operas, under
separate Interests. And this the generality of Spectators,
as well as the most approv'd Actors, had been
some time calling for as the only Expedient to recover
the Credit of the Stage and the valuable Interests of
its Menagers.</p>

<p>As the Condition of the Comedians at this time is
taken notice of in my <i>Dedication</i> of the <i>Wife's Resentment</i>
to the Marquis (now Duke) of <i>Kent</i>, and
then Lord-Chamberlain, which was publish'd above
thirty Years ago,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> when I had no thought of ever
troubling the World with this Theatrical History, I
see no Reason why it may not pass as a Voucher of
the Facts I am now speaking of; I shall therefore
give them in the very Light I then saw them. After
some Acknowledgment for his Lordship's Protection
of our (<i>Hay-Market</i>) Theatre, it is further said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Stage has, for many Years, 'till of late,
groan'd under the greatest Discouragements, w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>hich
have been very much, if not wholly, owing to the
Mismenagement of those that have aukwardly
govern'd it. Great Sums have been ventur'd upon
empty Projects and Hopes of immoderate Gains,
and when those Hopes have fail'd, the Loss has
been tyrannically deducted out of the Actors
Sallary. And if your Lordship had not redeem'd
them&mdash;<i>This is meant of our being suffer'd to come
over</i> to Swiney&mdash;&mdash;they were very near being
wholly laid aside, or, at least, the Use of their
Labour was to be swallow'd up in the pretended
Merit of Singing and Dancing."</p></blockquote>

<p>What follows relates to the Difficulties in dealing
with the then impracticable Menager, <i>viz.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"&mdash;And though your Lordship's Tenderness of
oppressing is so very just that you have rather
staid to convince a Man of your good Intentions
to him than to do him even a Service against his
Will; yet since your Lordship has so happily begun
the Establishment of the separate Diversions, we
live in hope that the same Justice and Resolution
will still persuade you to go as successfully through
with it. But while any Man is suffer'd to confound
the Industry and Use of them by acting publickly
in opposition to your Lordship's equal Intentions,
under a false and intricate Pretence of not being
able to comply with them, the Town is likely to
be more entertain'd with the private Dissensions
than the publick Performance of either, and the
Actors in a perpetual Fear and Necessity of
petitioning your Lordship every Season for new
Relief."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the State of the Stage immediately preceding
the time of Mr. <i>Brett</i>'s being admitted a joint
Patentee, who, as he saw with clearer Eyes what was
its evident Interest, left no proper Measures unattempted
to make this so long despair'd-of Union
practicable. The most apparent Difficulty to be got
over in this Affair was, what could be done for
<i>Swiney</i> in consideration of his being oblig'd to give
up those Actors whom the Power and Choice of the
Lord-Chamberlain had the Year before set him at
the Head of, and by whose Menagement those
Actors had found themselves in a prosperous Condition.
But an Accident at this time happily contributed
to make that Matter easy. The Inclination
of our People of Quality for foreign Operas had now
reach'd the Ears of <i>Italy</i>, and the Credit of their
Taste had drawn over from thence, without any
more particular Invitation, one of their capital Singers,
the famous Signior <i>Cavaliero Nicolini</i>: From whose
Arrival, and the Impatience of the Town to hear
him, it was concluded that Operas being now so
completely provided could not fail of Success, and
that by making <i>Swiney</i> sole Director of them the
Profits must be an ample Compensation for his Resignation
of the Actors. This Matter being thus
adjusted by <i>Swiney</i>'s Acceptance of the Opera only
to be perform'd at the <i>Hay-Market</i> House, the
Actors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
were all order'd to return to <i>Drury-Lane</i>,
there to remain (under the Patentees) her Majesty's
only Company of Comedians.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Plays and Operas being thus established upon
separate Interests,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> they were now left to make
the best of their way into Favour by their different
Merit. Although the Opera is not a Plant of our
Native Growth, nor what our plainer Appetites are
fond of, and is of so delicate a Nature that witho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>ut
excessive Charge it cannot live long among us;
especially while the nicest <i>Connoisseurs</i> in Musick
fall into such various Heresies in Taste, every Sect
pretending to be the true one: Yet, as it is call'd a
Theatrical Entertainment, and by its Alliance or
Neutrality has more or less affected our Domestick
Theatre, a short View of its Progress may be allow'd
a Place in our History.</p>

<p>After this new Regulation the first Opera that
appear'd was <i>Pyrrhus</i>. Subscriptions at that time
were not extended, as of late, to the whole Season,
but were limited to the first Six Days only of a new
Opera. The chief Performers in this were <i>Nicolini</i>,
<i>Valentini</i>, and Mrs. <i>Tofts</i>;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and for the inferior
Parts the best that were then to be found. Whatever
Praises may have been given to the most
famous Voices that have been heard since <i>Nicolini</i>,
upon the whole I cannot but come into the Opinion
that still prevails among several Persons of Condition
who are able to give a Reason for their liking, that
no Singer since his Time has so justly and gracefully
acquitted himself in whatever Character he
appear'd as <i>Nicolini</i>. At most the Difference between
him and the greatest Favourite of the Ladies,
<i>Farinelli</i>, amounted but to this, that he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>might sometimes
more exquisitely surprize us, but <i>Nicolini</i> (by
pleasing the Eye as well as the Ear) fill'd us with a
more various and <i>rational</i> Delight. Whether in
this Excellence he has since had any Competitor,
perhaps will be better judg'd by what the Critical
Censor of <i>Great Britain</i> says of him in his 115th
<i>Tatler</i>, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Nicolini</i> sets off the Character he bears in an
Opera by his Action, as much as he does the
Words of it by his Voice; every Limb and Finger
contributes to the Part he acts, insomuch that a
deaf Man might go along with him in the Sense
of it. There is scarce a beautiful Posture in an
old Statue which he does not plant himself in, as
the different Circumstances of the Story give occasion
for it&mdash;He performs the most ordinary
Action in a manner suitable to the Greatness of
his Character, and shews the Prince even in the
giving of a Letter or dispatching of a Message,
<i>&amp;c.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>His Voice at this first time of being among us (for
he made us a second Visit when it was impair'd) had
all that strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>, clear Sweetness of Tone so lately
admir'd in <i>Senesino</i>. A blind Man could scarce have
distinguish'd them; but in Volubility of Throat the
former had much the Superiority. This so excellent
Performer's Agreement was Eight Hundred Guineas
for the Year, which is but an eighth Part more than
half the Sum that has since been given to several that
could never totally surpass him: The Consequence
of which is, that the Losses by Operas, for several
Seasons, to the End of the Year 1738, have been so
great, that those Gentlemen of Quality who last
undertook the Direction of them, found it ridiculous
any longer to entertain the Publick at so extravagant
an Expence, while no one particular Person thought
himself oblig'd by it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Tofts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> who took her first Grounds of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>Musick
here in her own Country, before the <i>Italian</i> Taste
had so highly prevail'd, was then not an Adept in
it:<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Yet whatever Defect the fashionably Skilful
might find in her manner, she had, in the general
Sense of her Spectators, Charms that few of the
most learned Singers ever arrive at. The Beauty
of her fine proportion'd Figure, and exquisitely
sweet, silver Tone of her Voice, with that peculiar,
rapid Swiftness of her Throat, were Perfections not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
to be imitated by Art or Labour. <i>Valentini</i> I have
already mention'd, therefore need only say farther of
him, that though he was every way inferior to <i>Nicolini</i>,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
yet, as he had the Advantage of giving us our
first Impression of a good Opera Singer, he had still
his Admirers, and was of great Service in being so
skilful a Second to his Superior.</p>

<p>Three such excellent Performers in the same kind
of Entertainment at once, <i>England</i> till this Time had
never seen: Without any farther Comparison, then,
with the much dearer bought who have succeeded
them, their Novelty at least was a Charm that drew
vast Audiences of the fine World after them. <i>Swiney</i>,
their sole Director, was prosperous, and in one Winter
a Gainer by them of a moderate younger Brother's
Fortune. But as Musick, by so profuse a Dispensation
of her Beauties, could not always supply our dainty
Appetites with equal Variety, nor for ever please
us with the same Objects, the Opera, after one luxurious
Season, like the fine Wife of a roving Husband,
began to loose its Charms, and every Day discover'd
to our Satiety Imperfections which our former Fondness
had been blind to: But of this I shall observe
more in its Place: in the mean time, let us enquire
into the Productions of our native Theatre.</p>

<p>It may easily be conceiv'd, that by this entir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>e Re-union
of the two Companies Plays must generally
have been perform'd to a more than usual Advantage
and Exactness: For now every chief Actor, according
to his particular Capacity, piqued himself upon
rectifying those Errors which during their divided
State were almost unavoidable. Such a Choice of
Actors added a Richness to every good Play as it
was then serv'd up to the publick Entertainment:
The common People crowded to them with a more
joyous Expectation, and those of the higher Taste
return'd to them as to old Acquaintances, with new
Desires after a long Absence. In a Word, all Parties
seem'd better pleas'd but he who one might imagine
had most Reason to be so, the (lately) sole menaging
Patentee. He, indeed, saw his Power daily mould'ring
from his own Hands into those of Mr. <i>Brett</i>,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> whose
Gentlemanly manner of making every one's Business
easy to him, threw their old Master under a Disregard
which he had not been us'd to, nor could with
all his happy Change of Affairs support. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
this grave Theatrical Minister of whom I have been
oblig'd to make such frequent mention, had acquired
the Reputation of a most profound Politician by being
often incomprehensible, yet I am not sure that his
Conduct at this Juncture gave us not an evident
Proof that he was, like other frail Mortals, more a
Slave to his Passions than his Interest; for no Creature
ever seem'd more fond of Power that so little
knew how to use it to his Profit and Reputation;
otherwise he could not possibly have been so discontented,
in his secure and prosperous State of the
Theatre, as to resolve at all Hazards to destroy it.
We shall now see what infallible Measures he took
to bring this laudable Scheme to Perfection.</p>

<p>He plainly saw that, as this disagreeable Prosperity
was chiefly owing to the Conduct of Mr.
<i>Brett</i>, there could be no hope of recovering the Stage
to its former Confusion but by finding some effectual
Means to make Mr. <i>Brett</i> weary of his Charge: The
most probable he could for the Present think of, in
this Distress, was to call in the Adventurers (whom
for many Years, by his Defence in Law, he had kept
out) now to take care of their visibly improving
Interests.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> This fair Appearance of Equity being
known to be his own Proposal, he rightly guess'd
would incline these Adventurers to form a Majority
of Votes on his Side in all Theatrical Questions, and
consequently become a Check upon the Power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mr. <i>Brett</i>, who had so visibly alienated the Hearts
of his Theatrical Subjects, and now began to govern
without him. When the Adventurers, therefore, were
re-admitted to their old Government, after having
recommended himself to them by proposing to make
some small Dividend of the Profits (though he did
not design that Jest should be repeated) he took
care that the Creditors of the Patent, who were then
no inconsiderable Body, should carry off the every
Weeks clear Profits in proportion to their several
Dues and Demands. This Conduct, so speciously
just, he had Hopes would let Mr. <i>Brett</i> see that his
Share in the Patent was not so valuable an Acquisition
as perhaps he might think it; and probably
make a Man of his Turn to Pleasure soon weary of
the little Profit and great Plague it gave him. Now,
though these might be all notable Expedients, yet I
cannot say they would have wholly contributed to
Mr. <i>Brett</i>'s quitting his Post, had not a Matter of
much stronger Moment, an unexpected Dispute between
him and Sir <i>Thomas Skipwith</i>, prevailed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
him to lay it down: For in the midst of this flourishing
State of the Patent, Mr. <i>Brett</i> was surpriz'd with a
Subp&oelig;na into Chancery from Sir <i>Thomas Skipwith</i>,
who alledg'd in his Bill that the Conveyance he had
made of his Interest in the Patent to Mr. <i>Brett</i> was
only intended in Trust. (Whatever the Intent might
be, the Deed it self, which I then read, made no
mention of any Trust whatever.) But whether Mr.
<i>Brett</i>, as Sir <i>Thomas</i> farther asserted, had previously,
or after the Deed was sign'd, given his Word of
Honour that if he should ever make the Stage turn
to any Account or Profit, he would certainly restore
it: That, indeed, I can say nothing to; but be the
Deed valid or void, the Facts that apparently follow'd
were, that tho' Mr. <i>Brett</i> in his Answer to
this Bill absolutely deny'd his receiving this Assignment
either in Trust or upon any limited Condition
of what kind soever, yet he made no farther Defence
in the Cause. But since he found Sir <i>Thomas</i> had
thought fit on any Account to sue for the Restitution
of it, and Mr. <i>Brett</i> being himself conscious that, as
the World knew he had paid no Consideration for
it, his keeping it might be misconstrued, or not
favourably spoken of; or perhaps finding, tho' the
Profits were great, they were constantly swallowed
up (as has been observ'd) by the previous Satisfaction
of old Debts, he grew so tir'd of the Plague and
Trouble the whole Affair had given him, and was
likely still to engage him in, that in a few Weeks
after he withdrew himself from all Concern with th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>e
Theatre, and quietly left Sir <i>Thomas</i> to find his
better Account in it. And thus stood this undecided
Right till, upon the Demise of Sir <i>Thomas</i>, Mr.
<i>Brett</i> being allow'd the Charges he had been at in
this Attendance and Prosecution of the Union, reconvey'd
this Share of the Patent to Sir <i>George
Skipwith</i>, the Son and Heir of Sir <i>Thomas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Our Politician, the old Patentee, having thus fortunately
got rid of Mr. <i>Brett</i>, who had so rashly brought
the Patent once more to be a profitable Tenure, was
now again at Liberty to chuse rather to lose all than
not to have it all to himself.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere observ'd that nothing can so
effectually secure the Strength, or contribute to the
Prosperity of a good Company, as the Directors of
it having always, as near as possible, an amicable
Understanding with three or four of their best Actors,
whose good or ill-will must naturally make a wide
Difference in their profitable or useless manner of
serving them: While the Principal are kept reasonably
easy the lower Class can never be troublesome
without hurting themselves: But when a valuable
Actor is hardly treated, the Master must be a very
cunning Man that finds his Account in it. We shall
now see how far Experience will verify this Observation.</p>

<p>The Patentees thinking themselves secure in being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
restor'd to their former absolute Power over this now
only Company, chose rather to govern it by the
Reverse of the Method I have recommended: For
tho' the daily Charge of their united Company
amounted not, by a good deal, to what either of the
two Companies now in <i>Drury-Lane</i> or <i>Covent-Garden</i>
singly arises, they notwithstanding fell into
their former Politicks of thinking every Shilling
taken from a hired Actor so much clear Gain to the
Proprietor: Many of their People, therefore, were
actually, if not injudiciously, reduced in their Pay,
and others given to understand the same Fate was
design'd them; of which last Number I my self
was one; which occurs to my Memory by the
Answer I made to one of the Adventurers, who, in
Justification of their intended Proceeding,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> told me
that my Sallary, tho' it should be less than it was by
ten Shillings a Week, would still be more than ever
<i>Goodman</i> had, who was a better Actor than I could
pretend to be: To which I reply'd, This may be
true, but then you know, Sir, it is as true that
<i>Goodman</i> was forced to go upon the High-way for
a Livelihood. As this was a known Fact of <i>Goodman</i>,
my mentioning it on that Occasion I believe
was of Service to me; at least my Sallary was not
reduced after it. To say a Word or two more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
<i>Goodman</i>, so celebrated an Actor in his Time, perhaps
may set the Conduct of the Patentees in a
clearer Light. Tho' <i>Goodman</i> had left the Stage
before I came to it, I had some slight Acquaintance
with him. About the Time of his being expected
to be an Evidence against Sir <i>John Fenwick</i> in the
Assassination-Plot,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in 1696, I happen'd to meet him
at Dinner at Sir <i>Thomas Skipwith</i>'s, who, as he was
an agreeable Companion himself, liked <i>Goodman</i> for
the same Quality. Here it was that <i>Goodman</i>, without
Disguise or sparing himself, fell into a laughing
Account of several loose Passages of <i>his</i> younger
Life; as his being expell'd the University of <i>Cambridge</i>
for being one of the hot-headed Sparks who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
were concern'd in the cutting and defacing the Duke
of <i>Monmouth</i>'s Picture, then Chancellor of that
Place. But this Disgrace, it seems, had not disqualified
him for the Stage, which, like the Sea-Service,
refuses no Man for his Morals that is able-bodied:
There, as an Actor, he soon grew into a
different Reputation; but whatever his Merit might
be, the Pay of a hired Hero in those Days was so
very low that he was forced, it seems, to take the Air
(as he call'd it) and borrow what Money the first
Man he met had about him. But this being his first
Exploit of that kind which the Scantiness of his
Theatrical Fortune had reduced him to, King <i>James</i>
was prevail'd upon to pardon him: Which <i>Goodman</i>
said was doing him so particular an Honour that no
Man could wonder if his Acknowledgment had carried
him a little farther than ordinary into the Interest of
that Prince: But as he had lately been out of Luck
in backing his old Master, he had now no way to
get home the Life he was out upon his Account but
by being under the same Obligations to King
<i>William</i>.</p>

<p>Another Anecdote of him, though not quite so
dishonourably enterprizing, which I had from his
own Mouth at a different Time, will equally shew to
what low Shifts in Life the poor Provision for good
Actors, under the early Government of the Patent,
reduced them. In the younger Days of their
Heroism, Captain <i>Griffin</i> and <i>Goodman</i> were confined
by their moderate Sallaries to the Oeconomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
of lying together in the same Bed and having but
one whole Shirt between them: One of them being
under the Obligation of a Rendezvous with a fair
Lady, insisted upon his wearing it out of his Turn,
which occasion'd so high a Dispute that the Combat
was immediately demanded, and accordingly their
Pretensions to it were decided by a fair Tilt upon
the Spot, in the Room where they lay: But whether
<i>Clytus</i> or <i>Alexander</i> was obliged to see no Company
till a worse could be wash'd for him, seems not to
be a material Point in their History, or to my
Purpose.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>By this Rate of <i>Goodman</i>, who, 'till the Time of
his quitting the Stage never had more than what is
call'd forty Shillings a Week, it may be judg'd how
cheap the Labour of Actors had been formerly; and
the Patentees thought it a Folly to continue the
higher Price, (which their Divisions had since raised
them to) now there was but one Market for them;
but alas! they had forgot their former fatal Mistake
of squabbling with their Actors in 1695;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> nor did
they make any Allowance for the Changes and Operations
of Time, or enough consider the Interest the
Actors had in the Lord Chamberlain, on whose Protection
they might always rely, and whose Decrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
had been less restrain'd by Precedent than those of a
Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>In this mistaken View of their Interest, the Patentees,
by treating their Actors as Enemies, really
made them so: And when once the Masters of a
hired Company think not their Actors Hearts as
necessary as their Hands, they cannot be said to have
agreed for above half the Work they are able to do
in a Day: Or, if an unexpected Success should, notwithstanding,
make the Profits in any gross Disproportion
greater than the Wages, the Wages will
always have something worse than a Murmur at the
Head of them, that will not only measure the Merit
of the Actor by the Gains of the Proprietor, but will
never naturally be quiet till every Scheme of getting
into Property has been tried to make the Servant his
own Master: And this, as far as Experience can
make me judge, will always be in either of these
Cases the State of our <i>English</i> Theatre. What
Truth there may be in this Observation we are now
coming to a Proof of.</p>

<p>To enumerate all the particular Acts of Power in
which the Patentees daily bore hard upon <i>this</i> now
only Company of Actors, might be as tedious as unnecessary;
I shall therefore come at once to their
most material Grievance, upon which they grounded
their Complaint to the Lord Chamberlain, who, in
the Year following, 1709, took effectual Measures
for their Relief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>
<p>The Patentees observing that the Benefit-Plays of
the Actors towards the latter End of the Season
brought the most crowded Audiences in the Year,
began to think their own Interests too much neglected
by these partial Favours of the Town to their
Actors; and therefore judg'd it would not be impolitick
in such wholesome annual Profits to have
a Fellow-feeling with them. Accordingly an <i>Indulto</i><a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
was laid of one Third out of the Profits of every
Benefit for the proper Use and Behoof of the
Patent.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> But that a clear Judgment may be form'd
of the Equity or Hardship of this Imposition, it will
be necessary to shew from whence and from what
Causes the Actors Claim to Benefits originally proceeded.</p>

<p>During the Reign of King <i>Charles</i> an Actor's
Benefit had never been heard of. The first Indulgence
of this kind was given to Mrs. <i>Barry</i> (as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
been formerly observed<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>) in King <i>James</i>'s Time, in
Consideration of the extraordinary Applause that had
followed her Performance: But there this Favour
rested to her alone, 'till after the Division of the only
Company in 1695, at which time the Patentees were
soon reduced to pay their Actors half in good
Words and half in ready Money. In this precarious
Condition some particular Actors (however binding
their Agreements might be) were too poor or too
wise to go to Law with a Lawyer, and therefore
rather chose to compound their Arrears for their
being admitted to the Chance of having them made
up by the Profits of a Benefit-Play. This Expedient
had this Consequence; that the Patentees, tho' their
daily Audiences might, and did sometimes mend, still
kept the short Subsistance of their Actors at a stand,
and grew more steady in their Resolution so to keep
them, as they found them less apt to mutiny while
their Hopes of being clear'd off by a Benefit were
depending. In a Year or two these Benefits grew
so advantageous that they became at last the chief
Article in every Actor's Agreement.</p>

<p>Now though the Agreements of these united
Actors I am speaking of in 1708 were as yet only
Verbal, yet that made no difference in the honest
Obligation to keep them: But as Honour at that
time happen'd to have but a loose hold of their
Consciences, the Patentees rather chose to give it
the slip, and went on with their Work without it.
No Actor, therefore, could have his Benefit fi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>x'd 'till
he had first sign'd a Paper signifying his voluntary
Acceptance of it upon the above Conditions, any
Claims from Custom to the contrary notwithstanding.
Several at first refus'd to sign this Paper; upon
which the next in Rank were offer'd on the same
Conditions to come before the Refusers; this smart
Expedient got some few of the Fearful the Preference
to their Seniors; who, at last, seeing the Time
was too short for a present Remedy, and that they
must either come into the Boat or lose their Tide,
were forc'd to comply with what they as yet silently
resented as the severest Injury. In this Situation,
therefore, they chose to let the principal Benefits be
over, that their Grievances might swell into some
bulk before they made any Application for Redress
to the Lord-Chamberlain; who, upon hearing their
general Complaint, order'd the Patentees to shew
cause why their Benefits had been diminish'd one
Third, contrary to the common Usage? The Patentees
pleaded the sign'd Agreement, and the Actors
Receipts of the other two Thirds, in Full Satisfaction.
But these were prov'd to have been exacted
from them by the Methods already mentioned. They
notwithstanding insist upon them as lawful. But as
Law and Equity do not always agree, they were
look'd upon as unjust and arbitrary. Whereupon
the Patentees were warn'd at their Peril to refuse
the Actors full Satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> But here it was thought
necessary that Judgment should be for some time
respited, 'till the Actors, who had leave so t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>o do,
could form a Body strong enough to make the Inclination
of the Lord-Chamberlain to relieve them
practicable.</p>

<p>Accordingly <i>Swiney</i> (who was then sole Director
of the Opera only) had Permission to enter into a
private Treaty with such of the united Actors in
<i>Drury-Lane</i> as might be thought fit to head a Company
under their own Menagement, and to be
Sharers with him in the <i>Hay-Market</i>. The Actors
chosen for this Charge were <i>Wilks</i>, <i>Dogget</i>, Mrs.
<i>Oldfield</i>, and Myself. But before I proceed, lest it
should seem surprizing that neither <i>Betterton</i>, Mrs.
<i>Barry</i>, Mrs. <i>Bracegirdle</i>, or <i>Booth</i> were Parties in
this Treaty, it must be observ'd that <i>Betterton</i> was
now Seventy-three, and rather chose, with the Infirmities
of Age upon him, to rely on such Sallary as
might be appointed him, than to involve himself in
the Cares and Hurry that must unavoidably attend
the Regulation of a new Company. As to the two
celebrated Actresses I have named, this has been
my first proper Occasion of making it known that
they had both quitted the Stage the Year before this
Transaction was thought of.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> And <i>Booth</i> as yet was
scarce out of his Minority as an Actor, or only in
the Promise of that Reputation which, in about four
or five Years after, he happily arriv'd at. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
at this Juncture he was not so far overlook'd as not
to be offer'd a valuable Addition to his Sallary: But
this he declin'd, being, while the Patentees were
under this Distress, as much, if not more, in favour
with their chief Menager as a Schematist than as an
Actor: And indeed he appear'd, to my Judgment,
more inclin'd to risque his Fortune in <i>Drury-Lane</i>,
where he should have no Rival in Parts or Power,
than on any Terms to embark in the <i>Hay-Market</i>,
where he was sure to meet with Opponents in both.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
However, this his Separation from our Interest when
our All was at stake, afterwards kept his Advancement
to a Share with us in our more successful Days
longer postpon'd than otherwise it probably might
have been.</p>

<p>When Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i> was nominated as a joint
Sharer in our new Agreement to be made with <i>Swiney</i>,
<i>Dogget</i>, who had no Objection to her Merit, insisted
that our Affairs could never be upon a secure Foundation
if there was more than one Sex admitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
the Menagement of them. He therefore hop'd that
if we offer'd Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i> a <i>Carte Blanche</i> instead of
a Share, she would not think herself slighted. This
was instantly agreed to, and Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i> receiv'd it
rather as a Favour than a Disobligation: Her Demands
therefore were Two Hundred Pounds a Year
certain, and a Benefit clear of all Charges, which were
readily sign'd to. Her Easiness on this Occasion,
some Years after, when our Establishment was in
Prosperity, made us with less Reluctancy advance her
Two Hundred Pounds to Three Hundred Guineas
<i>per Annum</i>, with her usual Benefit, which, upon an
Average, for several Years at least doubled that Sum.</p>

<p>When a sufficient number of Actors were engag'd
under our Confederacy with <i>Swiney</i>, it was then
judg'd a proper time for the Lord-Chamberlain's
Power to operate, which, by lying above a Month
dormant, had so far recover'd the Patentees from any
Apprehensions of what might fall upon them from
their late Usurpations on the Benefits of the Actors,
that they began to set their Marks upon those who
had distinguish'd themselves in the Application for
Redress. Several little Disgraces were put upon
them, particularly in the Disposal of Parts in Plays
to be reviv'd, and as visible a Partiality was shewn
in the Promotion of those in their Interest, though
their Endeavours to serve them could be of no extraordinary
use. How often does History shew us,
in the same State of Courts, the same Politicks have
been practis'd? All this while the other Party were
passively silent, 'till one Day the Actor who particularly
solicited their Cause at the Lord-Chamberlain's
Office, being shewn there the Order sign'd for absolutely
silencing the Patentees, and ready to be serv'd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
flew back with the News to his Companions, then at
a Rehearsal in which he had been wanted; when
being call'd to his Part, and something hastily question'd
by the Patentee for his Neglect of Business:
This Actor, I say, with an erected Look and a
Theatrical Spirit, at once threw off the Mask and
roundly told him&mdash;&mdash;<i>Sir, I have now no more Business
Here than you have; in half an Hour you will
neither have Actors to command nor Authority to employ
them.</i>&mdash;&mdash;The Patentee, who though he could
not readily comprehend his mysterious manner of
Speaking, had just a Glimpse of Terror enough from
the Words to soften his Reproof into a cold formal
Declaration, That <i>if he would not do his Work he should
not be paid</i>.&mdash;But now, to complete the Catastrophe
of these Theatrical Commotions, enters the Messenger
with the Order of Silence in his Hand, whom
the same Actor officiously introduc'd, telling the
Patentee that the Gentleman wanted to speak with
him from the Lord-Chamberlain. When the Messenger
had delivered the Order, the Actor, throwing
his Head over his Shoulder towards the Patentee,
in the manner of <i>Shakespear</i>'s <i>Harry the Eighth</i> to
Cardinal <i>Wolsey</i>, cry'd&mdash;<i>Read o'er that! and now&mdash;to
Breakfast, with what Appetite you may</i>. Tho'
these Words might be spoken in too vindictive and
insulting a manner to be commended, yet, from the
Fulness of a Heart injuriously treated and now reliev'd
by that instant Occasion, why might they not
be pardon'd?<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>The Authority of the Patent now no longer subsisting,
all the confederated Actors immediately
walk'd out of the House, to which they never return'd
'till they became themselves the Tenants and Masters
of it.</p>

<p>Here agen we see an higher Instance of the Authority
of a Lord-Chamberlain than any of those I have e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
lsewhere mentioned: From whence that Power
might be deriv'd, as I have already said, I am not
Lawyer enough to know; however, it is evident that
a Lawyer obey'd it, though to his Cost; which might
incline one to think that the Law was not clearly
against it: Be that as it may, since the Law has
lately made it no longer a Question, let us drop the
Enquiry and proceed to the Facts which follow'd
this Order that silenc'd the Patent.</p>

<p>From this last injudicious Disagreement of the
Patentees with their principal Actors, and from what
they had suffered on the same Occasion in the Division
of their only Company in 1695, might we not
imagine there was something of Infatuation in their
Menagement? For though I allow Actors in general,
when they are too much indulg'd, or govern'd by an
unsteady Head, to be as unruly a Multitude as
Power can be plagued with; yet there is a Medium
which, if cautiously observed by a candid use of
Power, making them always know, without feeling,
their Superior, neither suffering their Encroachments
nor invading their Rights, with an immoveable Adherence
to the accepted Laws they are to walk by;
such a Regulation, I say, has never fail'd, in my Observation,
to have made them a tractable and profitable
Society. If the Government of a well-establish'd
Theatre were to be compar'd to that of a Nation,
there is no one Act of Policy or Misconduct in the
one or the other in which the Menager might not,
in some parallel Case, (laugh, if you please) be equally
applauded or condemned with the Statesman. Perhaps
this will not be found so wild a Conceit if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
look into the 193d <i>Tatler</i>, Vol. 4. where the Affairs
of the State and those of the very Stage which I am
now treating of, are, in a Letter from <i>Downs</i> the
Promptor,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> compar'd, and with a great deal of Wit
and Humour, set upon an equal Foot of Policy. The
Letter is suppos'd to have been written in the last
Change of the Ministry in Queen <i>Anne</i>'s Time. I
will therefore venture, upon the Authority of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Author's Imagination, to carry the Comparison as
high as it can possibly go, and say, That as I remember
one of our Princes in the last Century to
have lost his Crown by too arbitrary a Use of his
Power, though he knew how fatal the same Measures
had been to his unhappy Father before him, why
should we wonder that the same Passions taking
Possession of Men in lower Life, by an equally impolitick
Usage of their Theatrical Subjects, should
have involved the Patentees in proportionable Calamities.</p>

<p>During the Vacation, which immediately follow'd
the Silence of the Patent, both Parties were at leisure
to form their Schemes for the Winter: For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Patentee would still hold out, notwithstanding his
being so miserably maim'd or over-match'd: He had
no more Regard to Blows than a blind Cock of the
Game; he might be beaten, but would never yield;
the Patent was still in his Possession, and the Broad-Seal
to it visibly as fresh as ever: Besides, he had
yet some Actors in his Service,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> at a much cheaper
Rate than those who had left him, the Sallaries of
which last, now they would not work for him, he was
not oblig'd to pay.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In this way of thinking, he still
kept together such as had not been invited over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the <i>Hay-Market</i>, or had been influenc'd by <i>Booth</i> to
follow his Fortune in <i>Drury-Lane</i>.</p>

<p>By the Patentee's keeping these Remains of his
broken Forces together, it is plain that he imagin'd
this Order of Silence, like others of the same Kind,
would be recall'd, of course, after a reasonable time
of Obedience had been paid to it: But, it seems, he
had rely'd too much upon former Precedents; nor
had his Politicks yet div'd into the Secret that the
Court Power, with which the Patent had been so long
and often at variance, had now a mind to take the
publick Diversions more absolutely into their own
Hands: Not that I have any stronger Reasons for
this Conjecture than that the Patent never after this
Order of Silence got leave to play during the Queen's
Reign. But upon the Accession of his late Majesty,
Power having then a different Aspect, the Patent
found no Difficulty in being permitted to exercise its
former Authority for acting Plays, <i>&amp;c.</i> which, however,
from this time of their lying still, in 1709, did
not happen 'till 1714, which the old Patentee never
liv'd to see: For he dy'd about six weeks before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
new-built Theatre in <i>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</i> was open'd,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
where the first Play acted was the <i>Recruiting Officer</i>,
under the Menagement of his Heirs and Successors.
But of that Theatre it is not yet time to give any
further Account.</p>

<p>The first Point resolv'd on by the Comedians now
re-established in the <i>Hay-Market</i>,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was to alter the
Auditory Part of their Theatre, the Inconveniencies
of which have been fully enlarged upon in a former
Chapter. What embarrass'd them most in this
Design, was their want of Time to do it in a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
complete manner than it now remains in, otherwise
they had brought it to the original Model of that in
<i>Drury-Lane</i>, only in a larger Proportion, as the
wider Walls of it would require; as there are not
many Spectators who may remember what Form the
<i>Drury-Lane</i> Theatre stood in about forty Years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span> ago,
before the old Patentee, to make it hold more Money,
took it in his Head to alter it, it were but Justice to
lay the original Figure which Sir <i>Christopher Wren</i>
first gave it, and the Alterations of it now standing,
in a fair Light; that equal Spectators may see, if
they were at their choice, which of the Structures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
would incline them to a Preference. But in this
Appeal I only speak to such Spectators as allow a
good Play well acted to be the most valuable Entertainment
of the Stage. Whether such Plays (leaving <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the Skill of the dead or living Actors equally out of the
Question) have been more or less recommended in
their Presentation by either of these different Forms
of that Theatre, is our present Matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span> Enquiry.</p>

<p>It must be observ'd, then,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that the Area or Platform
of the old Stage projected about four Foot forwarder,
in a Semi-oval Figure, parallel to the Benches
of the Pit; and that the former lower Doors of
Entrance for the Actors were brought down between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
the two foremost (and then only) Pilasters; in the
Place of which Doors now the two Stage-Boxes are
fixt. That where the Doors of Entrance now are,
there formerly stood two additional Side-Wings, in
front to a full Set of Scenes, which had then almost
a double Effect in their Loftiness and Magnificence.</p>

<p>By this Original Form, the usual Station of the
Actors, in almost every Scene, was advanc'd at least
ten Foot nearer to the Audience than they now can
be; because, not only from the Stage's being shorten'd
in front, but likewise from the additional Interposition
of those Stage-Boxes, the Actors (in respect to
the Spectators that fill them) are kept so much more
backward from the main Audience than they us'd to
be: But when the Actors were in Possession of that
forwarder Space to advance upon, the Voice was
then more in the Centre of the House, so that the
most distant Ear had scarce the least Doubt or
Difficulty in hearing what fell from the weakest
Utterance: All Objects were thus drawn nearer to
the Sense; every painted Scene was stronger; every
grand Scene and Dance more extended; every rich
or fine-coloured Habit had a more lively Lustre:
Nor was the minutest Motion of a Feature (properly
changing with the Passion or Humour it suited) ever
lost, as they frequently must be in the Obscurity of
too great a Distance: And how valuable an Advantage
the Facility of hearing distinctly is to every
well-acted Scene, every common Spectator is a
Judge. A Voice scarce raised above the Tone of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Whisper, either in Tenderness, Resignation, innocent
Distress, or Jealousy suppress'd, often have as much
concern with the Heart as the most clamorous
Passions; and when on any of these Occasions such
affecting Speeches are plainly heard, or lost, how wide
is the Difference from the great or little Satisfaction
received from them? To all this a Master of a
Company may say, I now receive Ten Pounds more
than could have been taken formerly in every full
House! Not unlikely. But might not his House
be oftener full if the Auditors were oftener pleas'd?
Might not every bad House too, by a Possibility of
being made every Day better, add as much to one
Side of his Account as it could take from the other?
If what I have said carries any Truth in it, why
might not the original Form of this Theatre be
restor'd? but let this Digression avail what it may,
the Actors now return'd to the <i>Hay-Market</i>, as I
have observ'd, wanting nothing but length of Time
to have govern'd their Alteration of that Theatre by
this original Model of <i>Drury-Lane</i> which I have
recommended. As their time therefore was short,
they made their best use of it; they did something
to it: They contracted its Wideness by three
Ranges of Boxes on each side, and brought down its
enormous high Ceiling within so proportionable a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Compass that it effectually cur'd those hollow Undulations
of the Voice formerly complain'd of. The
Remedy had its Effect; their Audiences exceeded
their Expectation. There was now no other Theatre
open against them;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> they had the Town to themselves;
they were their own Masters, and the Profits
of their Industry came into their own Pockets.</p>

<p>Yet with all this fair Weather, the Season of their
uninterrupted Prosperity was not yet arriv'd; for the
great Expence and thinner Audiences of the Opera
(of which they then were equally Directors) was a constant
Drawback upon their Gains, yet not so far but
that their Income this Year was better than in their
late Station at <i>Drury-Lane</i>. But by the short Experience
we had then had of Operas; by the high
Reputation they seem'd to have been arriv'd at the
Year before; by their Power of drawing the whole
Body of Nobility as by Enchantment to their Solemnities;
by that Prodigality of Expence at which
they were so willing to support them; and from the
late extraordinary Profits <i>Swiney</i> had made of them,
what Mountains did we not hope from this Molehill?
But alas! the fairy Vision was vanish'd; this
bridal Beauty was grown familiar to the general
Taste, and Satiety began to make Excuses for its
want of Appetite: Or, what is still stranger, its
late Admirers now as much valued their Judgment
in being able to find out the Faults of the Performers,
as they had before in discovering their Excellencies.
The Truth is, that this kind of Entertainment bei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>ng
so entirely sensual, it had no Possibility of getting
the better of our Reason but by its Novelty; and that
Novelty could never be supported but by an annual
Change of the best Voices, which, like the finest
Flowers, bloom but for a Season, and when that is
over are only dead Nose-gays. From this Natural
Cause we have seen within these two Years even
<i>Farinelli</i> singing to an Audience of five and thirty
Pounds, and yet, if common Fame may be credited,
the same Voice, so neglected in one Country, has in
another had Charms sufficient to make that Crown
sit easy on the Head of a Monarch, which the Jealousy
of Politicians (who had their Views in his
keeping it) fear'd, without some such extraordinary
Amusement, his Satiety of Empire might tempt him
a second time to resign.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>There is, too, in the very Species of an <i>Italian</i> Singer
such an innate, fantastical Pride and Caprice, that the
Government of them (here at least) is almost impracticable.
This Distemper, as we were not sufficiently
warn'd or apprized of, threw our musical
Affairs into Perplexities we knew not easily how to
get out of. There is scarce a sensible Auditor <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>in
the Kingdom that has not since that Time had Occasion
to laugh at the several Instances of it: But
what is still more ridiculous, these costly Canary-Birds
have sometimes infested the whole Body of
our dignified Lovers of Musick with the same childish
Animosities: Ladies have been known to decline
their Visits upon account of their being of a different
musical Party. <i>C√¶sar</i> and <i>Pompey</i> made not a
warmer Division in the <i>Roman</i> Republick than those
Heroines, their Country Women, the <i>Faustina</i> and
<i>Cuzzoni</i>, blew up in our Common-wealth of Academical
Musick by their implacable Pretensions to Superiority.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
And while this Greatness of Soul is their
unalterable Virtue, it will never be practicable to
make two capital Singers of the same Sex do as
they should do in one Opera at the same time! no,
not tho' <i>England</i> were to double the Sums it has
already thrown after them: For even in their own
Country, where an extraordinary Occasion has called
a greater Number of their best to sing together, the
Mischief they have made has been proportionable;
an Instance of which, if I am rightly inform'd, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>happen'd
at <i>Parma</i>, where, upon the Celebration of the
Marriage of that Duke, a Collection was made of the
most eminent Voices that Expence or Interest could
purchase, to give as complete an Opera as the whole
vocal Power of <i>Italy</i> could form. But when it came
to the Proof of this musical Project, behold! what
woful Work they made of it! every Performer would
be a <i>C√¶sar</i> or Nothing; their several Pretensions to
Preference were not to be limited within the Laws
of Harmony; they would all choose their own Songs,
but not more to set off themselves than to oppose
or deprive another of an Occasion to shine: Yet
any one would sing a bad Song, provided no body
else had a good one, till at last they were thrown
together, like so many feather'd Warriors, for a Battle-royal
in a Cock-pit, where every one was oblig'd to
kill another to save himself! What Pity it was these
froward Misses and Masters of Musick had not been
engag'd to entertain the Court of some King of
<i>Morocco</i>, that could have known a good Opera from
a bad one! with how much Ease would such a
Director have brought them to better Order? But
alas! as it has been said of greater Things,</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Imperial <i>Rome</i> fell by the too great Strength of its
own Citizens! So fell this mighty Opera, ruin'd by
th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>e too great Excellency of its Singers! For, upon
the whole, it proved to be as barbarously bad as if
Malice it self had composed it.</p>

<p>Now though something of this kind, equally provoking,
has generally embarrass'd the State of
Operas these thirty Years, yet it was the Misfortune
of the menaging Actors at the <i>Hay-Market</i> to have
felt the first Effects of it: The Honour of the
Singer and the Interest of the Undertaker were so
often at Variance, that the latter began to have but
a bad Bargain of it. But not to impute more to the
Caprice of those Performers than was really true,
there were two different Accidents that drew Numbers
from our Audiences before the Season was
ended; which were another Company permitted to
act in <i>Drury-Lane</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and the long Trial of Doctor
<i>Sacheverel</i> in <i>Westminster-Hall</i>:<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> By the way, it
must be observed that this Company was not under
the Direction of the Patent (which continued still
silenced) but was set up by a third Interest, with a
License from Court. The Person to whom this new
License was granted was <i>William Collier</i>, Esq.,
a Lawyer of an enterprizing Head and a jovial
Heart; what sort of Favour he was in with the
People then in Power may be judg'd from his being
often admitted to partake with them those detach'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Hours of Life when Business was to give way to
Pleasure: But this was not all his Merit, he was at
the same time a Member of Parliament for <i>Truro</i> in
<i>Cornwall</i>, and we cannot suppose a Person so qualified
could be refused such a Trifle as a License to
head a broken Company of Actors. This sagacious
Lawyer, then, who had a Lawyer to deal with,
observing that his Antagonist kept Possession of a
Theatre without making use of it, and for which he
was not obliged to pay Rent unless he actually <i>did</i>
use it, wisely conceived it might be the Interest of
the joint Landlords, since their Tenement was in so
precarious a Condition, to grant a Lease to one who
had an undisputed Authority to be liable, by acting
Plays in it, to pay the Rent of it; especially when he
tempted them with an Offer of raising it from three
to four Pounds <i>per Diem</i>. His Project succeeded,
the Lease was sign'd; but the Means of getting into
Possession were to be left to his own Cost and Discretion.
This took him up but little Time; he immediately
laid Siege to it with a sufficient Number
of Forces, whether lawless or lawful I forget, but
they were such as obliged the old Governor to give
it up; who, notwithstanding, had got Intelligence of
his Approaches and Design time enough to carry off
every thing that was worth moving, except a great
Number of old Scenes and new Actors that could
not easily follow him.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>A ludicrous Account of this Transaction, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
fictitious Names, may be found in the 99th <i>Tatler</i>,
Vol. 2. which this Explanation may now render more
intelligible to the Readers of that agreeable Author.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>This other new License being now in Possession
of the <i>Drury-Lane</i> Theatre, those Actors whom the
Patentee ever since the Order of Silence had retain'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
in a State of Inaction, all to a Man came over to the
Service of <i>Collier</i>. Of these <i>Booth</i> was then the
chief.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The Merit of the rest had as yet made no
considerable Appearance, and as the Patentee had
not left a Rag of their Cloathing behind him, they
were but poorly equip'd for a publick Review; consequently
at their first Opening they were very
little able to annoy us. But during the Trial of
<i>Sacheverel</i> our Audiences were extremely weaken'd
by the better Rank of People's daily attending it:
While, at the same time, the lower Sort, who were
not equally admitted to that grand Spectacle, as
eagerly crowded into <i>Drury-Lane</i> to a new Comedy
call'd <i>The fair Quaker of Deal</i>. This Play having
some low Strokes of natural Humour in it, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
rightly calculated for the Capacity of the Actors
who play'd it, and to the Taste of the Multitude who
were now more disposed and at leisure to see it:<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
But the most happy Incident in its Fortune was the
Charm of the fair Quaker which was acted by Miss
<i>Santlow</i>, (afterwards Mrs. <i>Booth</i>) whose Person was
then in the full Bloom of what Beauty she might
pretend to: Before this she had only been admired
as the most excellent Dancer, which perhaps might
not a little contribute to the favourable Reception
she now met with as an Actress, in this Character
which so happily suited her Figure and Capacity:
The gentle Softness of her Voice, the composed
Innocence of her Aspect, the Modesty of her Dress,
the reserv'd Decency of her Gesture, and the Simplicity
of the Sentiments that naturally fell from her,
made her seem the amiable Maid she represented:
In a Word, not the enthusiastick Maid of <i>Orlean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>s</i>
was more serviceable of old to the <i>French</i> Army
when the <i>English</i> had distressed them, than this fair
Quaker was at the Head of that dramatick Attempt
upon which the Support of their weak Society depended.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>But when the Trial I have mention'd and the Run
of this Play was over, the Tide of the Town beginning
to turn again in our Favour, <i>Collier</i> was reduced
to give his Theatrical Affairs a different Scheme;
which advanced the Stage another Step towards that
Settlement which, in my Time, was of the longest
Duration.</p>

<p><i>The Patentee, having now no Actors, rebuilds the new Theatre in
</i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields<i>. A Guess at his Reasons for it. More
Changes in the State of the Stage. The Beginning of its better
Days under the </i>Triumvirate<i> of Actors. A Sketch of their governing
Characters.</i></p></div>

<p>As coarse Mothers may have comely Children,
so Anarchy has been the Parent of many a
good Government; and by a Parity of possible
Consequences, we shall find that from the frequent
Convulsions of the Stage arose at last its longest
Settlement and Prosperity; which many of my
Readers (or if I should happen to have but few of
them, many of my Spectators at least) who I hope
have not yet liv'd half their Time, will be able to
remember.</p>

<p>Though the Patent had been often under Distresse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>s,
it had never felt any Blow equal to this unrevoked
Order of Silence; which it is not easy to
conceive could have fallen upon any other Person's
Conduct than that of the old Patentee: For if he
was conscious of his being under the Subjection of
that Power which had silenc'd him, why would he
incur the Danger of a Suspension by his so obstinate
and impolitick Treatment of his Actors? If he
thought such Power over him illegal, how came he
to obey it now more than before, when he slighted a
former Order that injoin'd him to give his Actors
their Benefits on their usual Conditions?<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But to do
him Justice, the same Obstinacy that involv'd him
in these Difficulties, at last preserv'd to his Heirs
the Property of the Patent in its full Force and
Value;<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> yet to suppose that he foresaw a milder use
of Power in some future Prince's Reign might be
more favourable to him, is begging at best but a cold
Question. But whether he knew that this broken
Condition of the Patent would not make his troublesome
Friends the Adventurers fly from it as from
a falling House, seems not so difficult a Question.
However, let the Reader form his own Judgment <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>of
them from the Facts that follow'd: It must therefore
be observ'd, that the Adventurers seldom came near
the House but when there was some visible Appearance
of a Dividend: But I could never hear that
upon an ill Run of Audiences they had ever returned
or brought in a single Shilling, to make good the
Deficiencies of their daily Receipts. Therefore, as
the Patentee in Possession had alone, for several
Years, supported and stood against this Uncertainty
of Fortune, it may be imagin'd that his Accounts
were under so voluminous a Perplexity that few of
those Adventurers would have Leisure or Capacity
enough to unravel them: And as they had formerly
thrown away their Time and Money at law in a fruitless
Enquiry into them, they now seem'd to have
intirely given up their Right and Interest: And,
according to my best Information, notwithstanding
the subsequent Gains of the Patent have been sometimes
extraordinary, the farther Demands or Claims
of Right of the Adventurers have lain dormant
above these five and twenty Years.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Having shewn by what means <i>Collier</i> had dispossess'd
this Patentee, not only of the <i>Drury-Lane</i>
House, but likewise of those few Actor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>s which he had
kept for some time unemploy'd in it, we are now led
to consider another Project of the same Patentee,
which, if we are to judge of it by the Event, has
shewn him more a Wise than a Weak Man; which
I confess at the time he put it in Execution seem'd
not so clear a Point: For notwithstanding he now
saw the Authority and Power of his Patent was
superseded, or was at best but precarious, and that
he had not one Actor left in his Service, yet, under
all these Dilemma's and Distresses, he resolv'd upon
rebuilding the New Theatre in <i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</i>,
of which he had taken a Lease, at a low Rent, ever
since <i>Betterton</i>'s Company had first left it.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> This
Conduct seem'd too deep for my Comprehension!
What are we to think of his taking this Lease in
the height of his Prosperity, when he could have no
Occasion for it? Was he a Prophet? Could he
then foresee he should, one time or other, be turn'd
out of <i>Drury-Lane</i>? Or did his mere Appetite of
Architecture urge him to build a House, while he
could not be sure he should ever have leave to make
use of it? But of all this we may think as we please;
whatever was his Motive, he, at his own Expence,
in this Interval of his having nothing else to do, rebuilt
that Theatre from the Ground, as it is now
standing.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> As for the Order of Silence, he seem'd
little concern'd at it while it gave him so much uninterrupted
Leisure to supervise a Work which he
naturally took Delight in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>After this Defeat of the Patentee, the Theatrical
Forces of <i>Collier</i> in <i>Drury-Lane</i>, notwithstanding
their having drawn the Multitude after them for
about three Weeks during the Trial of <i>Sacheverel</i>,
had made but an indifferent Campaign at the end of
the Season. <i>Collier</i> at least found so little Account
in it, that it obliged him to push his Court-Interest
(which, wherever the Stage was concern'd, was not
inconsiderable) to support him in another Scheme;
which was, that in consideration of his giving up the
<i>Drury-Lane</i>, Cloaths, Scenes, and Actors, to <i>Swiney</i>
and his joint Sharers in the <i>Hay-Market</i>, he (<i>Collier</i>)
might be put into an equal Possession of the <i>Hay-Market</i>
Theatre, with all the Singers, <i>&amp;c.</i> and be
made sole Director of the Opera. Accordingly, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Permission of the Lord Chamberlain, a Treaty was
enter'd into, and in a few Days ratified by all Parties,
conformable to the said Preliminaries.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This was
that happy Crisis of Theatrical Liberty which the
labouring Comedians had long sigh'd for, and which,
for above twenty Years following, was so memorably
fortunate to them.</p>

<p>However, there were two hard Articles in this
Treaty, which, though it might be Policy in the
Actors to comply with, yet the Imposition of them
seem'd little less despotick than a Tax upon the
Poor when a Government did not want it.</p>

<p>The first of these Articles was, That whereas the
sole License for acting Plays was presum'd to be a
more profitable Authority than that for acting Operas
only, that therefore Two Hundred Pounds a Year
should be paid to <i>Collier</i>, while Master of the Opera,
by the Comedians; to whom a verbal Assurance
was given by the <i>Plenipo'</i>s on the Court-side, that
while such Payment subsisted no other Company
should be permitted to act Plays against them within
the Liberties, <i>&amp;c.</i> The other Article was, That on
every <i>Wednesday</i> whereon an Opera could be perform'd,
the Plays should, <i>toties quoties</i>, be silent at
<i>Drury-Lane</i>, to give the Opera a fairer Chance for
a full House.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>
<p>This last Article, however partial in the Intention,
was in its Effect of great Advantage to the sharing
Actors: For in all publick Entertainments a Day's
Abstinence naturally increases the Appetite to them:
Our every <i>Thursday</i>'s Audience, therefore, was
visibly the better by thus making the Day before it
a Fast. But as this was not a Favour design'd us,
this Prohibition of a Day, methinks, deserves a little
farther Notice, because it evidently took a sixth Part
of their Income from all the hired Actors, who were
only paid in proportion to the Number of acting
Days. This extraordinary Regard to Operas was,
in effect, making the Day-labouring Actors the
principal Subscribers to them, and the shutting out
People from the Play every <i>Wednesday</i> many murmur'd
at as an Abridgment of their usual Liberty.
And tho' I was one of those who profited by that
Order, it ought not to bribe me into a Concealment
of what was then said and thought of it. I remember
a Nobleman of the first Rank, then in a high Post,
and not out of Court-Favour, said openly behind the
Scenes&mdash;&mdash;<i>It was shameful to take part of the Actors
Bread from them to support the silly Diversion of
People of Quality</i>. But alas! what was all this
Grievance when weighed against the Qualifications
of so grave and staunch a Senator as <i>Collier</i>? Such
visible Merit, it seems, was to be made easy, tho' at
the Expence of the&mdash;I had almost said, <i>Honour</i> of
the Court, whose gracious Intention for the Theatrical
Common-wealth might have shone with thrice
the Lustre if such a paltry Price had not been paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
for it. But as the Government of the Stage is but
that of the World in Miniature, we ought not to
have wonder'd that <i>Collier</i> had Interest enough to
quarter the Weakness of the Opera upon the Strength
of the Comedy. General good Intentions are not
always practicable to a Perfection. The most necessary
Law can hardly pass, but a Tenderness to some
private Interest shall often hang such Exceptions upon
particular Clauses, 'till at last it comes out lame and
lifeless, with the Loss of half its Force, Purpose, and
Dignity. As, for Instance, how many fruitless Motions
have been made in Parliaments to moderate
the enormous Exactions in the Practice of the Law?
And what sort of Justice must that be call'd, which,
when a Man has not a mind to pay you a Debt of
Ten Pounds, it shall cost you Fifty before you can
get it? How long, too, has the Publick been labouring
for a Bridge at <i>Westminster</i>? But the Wonder
that it was not built a Hundred Years ago ceases
when we are told, That the Fear of making one End
of <i>London</i> as rich as the other has been so long an
Obstruction to it:<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
And though it might seem a still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
greater Wonder, when a new Law for building one
had at last got over that Apprehension, that it should
meet with any farther Delay; yet Experience has
shewn us that the Structure of this useful Ornament
to our Metropolis has been so clogg'd by private
Jobs that were to be pick'd out of the Undertaking,
and the Progress of the Work so disconcerted by a
tedious Contention of private Interests and Endeavours
to impose upon the Publick abominable Bargains,
that a whole Year was lost before a single
Stone could be laid to its Foundation. But Posterity
will owe its Praises to the Zeal and Resolution of a
truly Noble Commissioner, whose distinguish'd Impatience
has broke thro' those narrow Artifices, those
false and frivolous Objections that delay'd it, and
has already began to raise above the Tide that future
Monument of his Publick Spirit.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>How far all this may be allow'd applicable to the
State of the Stage is not of so great Importance, nor
so much my Concern, as that what is observ'd upon
it should always remain a memorable Truth, to the
Honour of that Nobleman. But now I go on:
<i>Collier</i> being thus possess'd of his Musical Government,
thought his best way would be to farm it out
to a Gentleman, <i>Aaron Hill</i>, Esq.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> (who he had
reason to suppose knew something more of Theatrical
Matters than himself) at a Rent, if I mistake not, of
Six Hundred Pounds <i>per Annum</i>: But bef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>ore the
Season was ended (upon what occasion, if I could
remember, it might not be material to say) took it
into his Hands again: But all his Skill and Interest
could not raise the Direction of the Opera to so
good a Post as he thought due to a Person of his
Consideration: He therefore, the Year following,
enter'd upon another high-handed Scheme, which,
'till the Demise of the Queen, turn'd to his better
Account.</p>

<p>After the Comedians were in Possession of <i>Drury-Lane</i>,
from whence during my time upon the Stage
they never departed, their Swarm of Audiences exceeded
all that had been seen in thirty Years before;
which, however, I do not impute so much to the
Excellence of their Acting as to their indefatigable
Industry and good Menagement; for, as I have often
said, I never thought in the general that we stood
in any Place of Comparison with the eminent Actors
before us; perhaps, too, by there being now an End
of the frequent Divisions and Disorders that had
from time to time broke in upon and frustrated their
Labours, not a little might be contributed to their
Success.</p>

<p><i>Collier</i>, then, like a true liquorish Courtier, observing
the Prosperity of a Theatre, which he the Year
before h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>ad parted with for a worse, began to meditate
an Exchange of Theatrical Posts with <i>Swiney</i>, who
had visibly very fair Pretensions to that he was in,
by his being first chosen by the Court to regulate
and rescue the Stage from the Disorders it had suffer'd
under its former Menagers:<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Yet <i>Collier</i> knew
that sort of Merit could stand in no Competition
with his being a Member of Parliament: He therefore
had recourse to his Court-Interest (where meer
Will and Pleasure at that time was the only Law
that dispos'd of all Theatrical Rights) to oblige
Swiney to let him be off from his bad Bargain for a
better. To this it may be imagin'd <i>Swiney</i> demurred,
and as he had Reason, strongly remonstrated against
it: But as <i>Collier</i> had listed his Conscience under
the Command of Interest, he kept it to strict Duty,
and was immoveable; insomuch that Sir <i>John Vanbrugh</i>,
who was a Friend to <i>Swiney</i>, and who, by his
Intimacy with the People in Power, better knew the
Motive of their Actions, advis'd <i>Swiney</i> rather to
accept of the Change, than by a Non-compliance to
hazard his being excluded from any Post or Concern
in either of the Theatres: To conclude, it was not
long before <i>Collier</i> had procured a new License for
acting Plays, <i>&amp;c.</i> for himself, <i>Wilks</i>, <i>Dogget</i>, and
<i>Cibber</i>, exclusive of <i>Swiney</i>, who by this new Regulation
was reduc'd to his <i>Hobson</i>'s Choice of the
Opera.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><i>Swiney</i> being thus transferr'd to the Opera<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
sinking Condition <i>Collier</i> had left it, found the Receipts
of it in the Winter following, 1711, so far short
of the Expences, that he was driven to attend his
Fortune in some more favourable Climate, where he
remain'd twenty Years an Exile from his Friends
and Country, tho' there has been scarce an <i>English</i>
Gentleman who in his <i>Tour</i> of <i>France</i> or <i>Italy</i> has
not renew'd or created an Acquaintance with him.
As this is a Circumstance that many People may
have forgot, I cannot remember it without that Regard
and Concern it deserves from all that know
him: Yet it is some Mitigation of his Misfortune
that since his Return to <i>England</i>, his grey Hairs and
cheerful Disposition have still found a general Welcome
among his foreign and former domestick Acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Collier</i> being now first-commission'd Menager with
the Comedians, drove them, too, to the last Inch of a
hard Bargain (the natural Consequence of all Treaties
between Power and Necessity.) He not only demanded
six hundred a Year neat Money, the Price
at which he had farm'd out his Opera, and to make
the Business a <i>Sine-cure</i> to him, but likewise insisted
upon a Moiety of the Two hundred that had been
levied upon us the Year before in Aid of the Operas;
in all 700<i>l.</i> These large and ample Conditions,
considering in what Hands we were, we resolv'd to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
swallow without wry Faces; rather chusing to run
any Hazard than contend with a formidable Power
against which we had no Remedy: But so it happen'd
that Fortune took better care of our Interest
than we ourselves had like to have done: For had
<i>Collier</i> accepted of our first Offer, of an equal Share
with us, he had got three hundred Pounds a Year
more by complying with it than by the Sum he imposed
upon us, our Shares being never less than a
thousand annually to each of us, 'till the End of the
Queen's Reign in 1714. After which <i>Collier</i>'s Commission
was superseded, his Theatrical Post, upon
the Accession of his late Majesty, being given to Sir
<i>Richard Steele</i>.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>From these various Revolutions in the Government
of the Theatre, all owing to the Patentees mistaken
Principle of increasing their Profits by too far
enslaving their People, and keeping down the Price
of good Actors (and I could almost insist that giving
large Sallaries to bad Ones could not have had a
worse Consequence) I say, when it is consider'd that
the Authority for acting Plays, <i>&amp;c.</i> was thought of
so little worth that (as has been observ'd) Sir <i>Thomas
Skipwith</i> gave away his Share of it, and the Adventurers
had fled from it; that Mr. <i>Congreve</i>, at another
time, had voluntarily resign'd it; and Sir <i>John Vanbrugh</i>
(meerly to get the Rent of his new House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
paid) had, by Leave of the Court, farm'd out his
License to <i>Swiney</i>, who not without some Hesitation
had ventur'd upon it; let me say again, out of this
low Condition of the Theatre, was it not owing to
the Industry of three or four Comedians that a new
Place was now created for the Crown to give away,
without any Expence attending it, well worth the
Acceptance of any Gentleman whose Merit or Services
had no higher Claim to Preferment, and which
<i>Collier</i> and Sir <i>Richard Steele</i>, in the two last Reigns,
successively enjoy'd? Tho' I believe I may have
said something like this in a former Chapter,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> I am
not unwilling it should be twice taken notice of.</p>

<p>We are now come to that firm Establishment of
the Theatre, which, except the Admittance of <i>Booth</i>
into a Share and <i>Dogget</i>'s retiring from it, met with
no Change or Alteration for above twenty Years
after.</p>

<p><i>Collier</i>, as has been said, having accepted of a certain
Appointment of seven hundred <i>per Annum</i>,
<i>Wilks</i>, <i>Dogget</i>, and Myself were now the only acting
Menagers under the Queen's License; which being
a Grant but during Pleasure oblig'd us to a Conduct
that might not undeserve that Favour. At this
Time we were All in the Vigour of our Capacities as
Actors, and our Prosperity enabled us to pay at
least double the Sallaries to what the same Actors
had usually receiv'd, or could have hoped for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span> under
the Government of the Patentees. <i>Dogget</i>, who was
naturally an Oeconomist, kept our Expences and
Accounts to the best of his Power within regulated
Bounds and Moderation. <i>Wilks</i>, who had a stronger
Passion for Glory than Lucre, was a little apt to be
lavish in what was not always as necessary for the
Profit as the Honour of the Theatre: For example,
at the Beginning of almost every Season, he would
order two or three Suits to be made or refresh'd for
Actors of moderate Consequence, that his having
constantly a new one for himself might seem less
particular, tho' he had as yet no new Part for it.
This expeditious Care of doing us good without waiting
for our Consent to it, <i>Dogget</i> always look'd upon
with the Eye of a Man in Pain: But I, who hated
Pain, (tho' I as little liked the Favour as <i>Dogget</i>
himself) rather chose to laugh at the Circumstance,
than complain of what I knew was not to be cured
but by a Remedy worse than the Evil. Upon these
Occasions, therefore, whenever I saw him and his
Followers so prettily dress'd out for an old Play, I
only commended his Fancy; or at most but whisper'd
him not to give himself so much trouble about others,
upon whose Performance it would but be thrown
away: To which, with a smiling Air of Triumph
over my want of Penetration, he has reply'd&mdash;Why,
now, that was what I really did it for! to shew others
that I love to take care of them as well as of myself.
Thus, whenever he made himself easy, he had not
the least Conception, let the Expence be what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
would, that we could possibly dislike it. And from
the same Principle, provided a thinner Audience
were liberal of their Applause, he gave himself little
Concern about the Receipt of it. As in these different
Tempers of my Brother-Menagers there might
be equally something right and wrong, it was equally
my Business to keep well with them both: And tho'
of the two I was rather inclin'd to <i>Dogget</i>'s way of
thinking, yet I was always under the disagreeable
Restraint of not letting <i>Wilks</i> see it: Therefore,
when in any material Point of Menagement they
were ready to come to a Rupture, I found it adviseable
to think neither of them absolutely in the wrong;
but by giving to one as much of the Right in his
Opinion this way as I took from the other in that,
their Differences were sometimes soft'ned into Concessions,
that I have reason to think prevented many
ill Consequences in our Affairs that otherwise might
have attended them. But this was always to be
done with a very gentle Hand; for as <i>Wilks</i> was apt
to be easily hurt by Opposition, so when he felt it he
was as apt to be insupportable. However, there were
some Points in which we were always unanimous.
In the twenty Years while we were our own Directors,
we never had a Creditor that had occasion to
come twice for his Bill; every <i>Monday</i> Morning discharged
us of all Demands before we took a Shilling
for our own Use. And from this time we neither
ask'd any Actor, nor were desired by them, to sign
any written Agreement (to the best of my Memory)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
whatsoever: The Rate of their respective Sallaries
were only enter'd in our daily Pay-Roll; which plain
Record every one look'd upon as good as City-Security:
For where an honest Meaning is mutual,
the mutual Confidence will be Bond enough in Conscience
on both sides: But that I may not ascribe
more to our Conduct than was really its Due, I ought
to give Fortune her Share of the Commendation;
for had not our Success exceeded our Expectation,
it might not have been in our Power so thoroughly to
have observ'd those laudable Rules of Oeconomy,
Justice, and Lenity, which so happily supported us:
But the Severities and Oppression we had suffer'd
under our former Masters made us incapable of
imposing them on others; which gave our whole
Society the cheerful Looks of a rescued People.
But notwithstanding this general Cause of Content,
it was not above a Year or two before the Imperfection
of human Nature began to shew itself in contrary
Symptoms. The Merit of the Hazards which
the Menagers had run, and the Difficulties they had
combated in bringing to Perfection that Revolution
by which they had all so amply profited in the
Amendment of their general Income, began now to
be forgotten; their Acknowledgments and thankful
Promises of Fidelity were no more repeated, or
scarce thought obligatory: Ease and Plenty by an
habitual Enjoyment had lost their Novelty, and the
Largeness of their Sallaries seem'd rather lessen'd
than advanc'd by the extraordinary Gains of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>e
Undertakers; for that is the Scale in which the hired
Actor will always weigh his Performance; but whatever
Reason there may seem to be in his Case, yet,
as he is frequently apt to throw a little Self-partiality
into the Balance, that Consideration may a good
deal alter the Justness of it. While the Actors, therefore,
had this way of thinking, happy was it for the
Menagers that their united Interest was so inseparably
the same, and that their Skill and Power in
Acting stood in a Rank so far above the rest, that if
the whole Body of private Men had deserted them,
it would yet have been an easier matter for the
Menagers to have pick'd up Recruits, than for the
Deserters to have found proper Officers to head
them. Here, then, in this Distinction lay our Security:
Our being Actors ourselves was an Advantage
to our Government which all former Menagers, who
were only idle Gentlemen, wanted: Nor was our
Establishment easily to be broken, while our Health
and Limbs enabled us to be Joint-labourers in the
Work we were Masters of.</p>
<p>The only Actor who, in the Opinion of the Publick,
seem'd to have had a Pretence of being advanc'd
to a Share with us was certainly <i>Booth</i>: But
when it is consider'd how strongly he had oppos'd
the Measures that had made us Menagers, by setting
himself (as has been observ'd) at the Head of an
opposite Interest,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> he could not as yet have much to
complain of: Beside, if the Court had thought him,
now, an equal Object of Favour, it could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
been in our Power to have oppos'd his Preferment:
This I mention, not to take from his Merit, but to
shew from what Cause it was not as yet better provided
for. Therefore it may be no Vanity to say,
our having at that time no visible Competitors on
the Stage was the only Interest that rais'd us to be
the Menagers of it.</p>
<p>But here let me rest a while, and since at my
time of Day our best Possessions are but Ease and
Quiet, I must be content, if I will have Sallies of
Pleasure, to take up with those only that are to be
found in Imagination. When I look back, therefore,
on the Storms of the Stage we had been
toss'd in; when I consider that various Vicissitude
of Hopes and Fears we had for twenty Years
struggled with, and found ourselves at last thus
safely set on Shore to enjoy the Produce of our own
Labours, and to have rais'd those Labours by our
Skill and Industry to a much fairer Profit, than our
Task-masters by all their severe and griping Government
had ever reap'd from them, a good-natur'd
Reader, that is not offended at the Comparison of
great things with small, will allow was a Triumph
in proportion equal to those that have attended the
most heroick Enterprizes for Liberty! What Transport
could the first <i>Brutus</i> feel upon his Expulsion
of the <i>Tarquins</i> greater than that which now danc'd
in the Heart of a poor Actor, who, from an injur'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Labourer, unpaid his Hire, had made himself, without
Guilt, a legal Menager of his own Fortune?
Let the Grave and Great contemn or yawn at these
low Conceits, but let me be happy in the Enjoyment
of them! To this Hour my Memory runs o'er that
pleasing Prospect of Life past with little less Delight
than when I was first in the real Possession of it.
This is the natural Temper of my Mind, which my
Acquaintance are frequently Witnesses of: And as
this was all the Ambition Providence had made my
obscure Condition capable of, I am thankful that
Means were given me to enjoy the Fruits of it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Menaging Actors
were now in a happier Situation than their
utmost Pretensions could have expected, yet it is
not to be suppos'd but wiser Men might have mended
it. As we could not all govern our selves, there were
Seasons when we were not all fit to govern others.
Our Passions and our Interest drew not always the
same way. <i>Self</i> had a great Sway in our Debates:
We had our Partialities; our Prejudices; our Favourites
of less Merit; and our Jealousies of those
who came too near us; Frailties which Societies o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>f
higher Consideration, while they are compos'd of
Men, will not always be free from. To have been
constantly capable of Unanimity had been a Blessing
too great for our Station: One Mind among three
People were to have had three Masters to one Servant;
but when that one Servant is called three different
ways at the same time, whose Business is to be
done first? For my own Part, I was forced almost
all my Life to give up my Share of him. And if I
could, by Art or Persuasion, hinder others from
making what I thought a wrong use of their Power,
it was the All and utmost I desired. Yet, whatever
might be our Personal Errors, I shall think I have
no Right to speak of them farther than where the
Publick Entertainment was affected by them. If
therefore, among so many, some particular Actors
were remarkable in any part of their private Lives,
that might sometimes make the World merry without
Doors, I hope my laughing Friends will excuse
me if I do not so far comply with their Desires or
Curiosity as to give them a Place in my History. I
can only recommend such Anecdotes to the Amusement
of a Noble Person, who (in case I conceal
them) does me the flattering Honour to threaten my
Work with a Supplement. 'Tis enough for me that
such Actors had their Merits to the Publick: Let
those recite their Imperfections who are themselves
without them: It is my Misfortune not to have that
Qualification. Let us see then (whatever was amiss
in it) how our Administration went forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>When we were first invested with this Power, the
Joy of our so unexpectedly coming into it kept us
for some time in Amity and Good-Humour with one
another: And the Pleasure of reforming the many
false Measures, Absurdities, and Abuses, that, like
Weeds, had suck'd up the due Nourishment from
the Fruits of the Theatre, gave us as yet no leisure
for private Dissentions. Our daily Receipts exceeded
our Imagination: And we seldom met as a
Board to settle our weekly Accounts without the Satisfaction
of Joint-Heirs just in Possession of an unexpected
Estate that had been distantly intail'd upon
them. Such a sudden Change of our Condition it
may be imagin'd could not but throw out of us a
new Spirit in almost every Play we appear'd in:
Nor did we ever sink into that common Negligence
which is apt to follow Good-fortune: Industry we
knew was the Life of our Business; that it not only
conceal'd Faults, but was of equal Value to greater
Talents without it; which the Decadence once of
<i>Betterton</i>'s Company in <i>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</i> had
lately shewn us a Proof of.</p>

<p>This then was that happy Period, when both
Actors and Menagers were in their highest Enjoyment
of general Content and Prosperity. Now it
was that the politer World, too, by their decent
Attention, their sensible Taste, and their generous
Encouragements to Authors and Actors, once more
saw that the Stage, under a due Regulation, was
capable of being what the wisest Ages thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
<i>might</i> be, The most rational Scheme that Human
Wit could form to dissipate with Innocence the
Cares of Life, to allure even the Turbulent or Ill-disposed
from worse Meditations, and to give the
leisure Hours of Business and Virtue an instructive
Recreation.</p>

<p>If this grave Assertion is less recommended by
falling from the Pen of a Comedian, I must appeal
for the Truth of it to the Tragedy of <i>Cato</i>, which was
first acted in 1712.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> I submit to the Judgment of
those who were then the sensible Spectators of it, if
the Success and Merit of that Play was not an
Evidence of every Article of that Value which I
have given to a decent Theatre? But (as I was
observing) it could not be expected the Summer
Days I am speaking of could be the constant Weather
of the Year; we had our clouded Hours as well as
our sun-shine, and were not always in the same Good-Humour
with one another: Fire, Air, and Water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
could not be more vexatiously opposite than the
different Tempers of the Three Menagers, though
they might equally have their useful as well as their
destructive Qualities. How variously these Elements
in our several Dispositions operated may be judged
from the following single Instance, as well as a
thousand others, which, if they were all to be told,
might possibly make my Reader wish I had forgot
them.</p>

<p>Much about this time, then, there came over from
<i>Dublin</i> Theatre two uncelebrated Actors to pick up
a few Pence among us in the Winter, as <i>Wilks</i> had
a Year or two before done on their side the Water
in the Summer.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But it was not so clear to <i>Dogget</i> and
myself that it was in their Power to do us the same
Service in <i>Drury-Lane</i> as <i>Wilks</i> might have done
them in <i>Dublin</i>. However, <i>Wilks</i> was so much a
Man of Honour that he scorned to be outdone in
the least Point of it, let the Cost be what it would
to his Fellow-Menagers, who had no particular
Accounts of Honour open with them. To acquit
himself therefore with a better Grace, <i>Wilk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>s</i> so
order'd it, that his <i>Hibernian</i> Friends were got upon
our Stage before any other Menager had well heard
of their Arrival. This so generous Dispatch of their
Affair gave <i>Wilks</i> a very good Chance of convincing
his Friends that Himself was sole Master of the
Masters of the Company. Here, now, the different
Elements in our Tempers began to work with us.
While <i>Wilks</i> was only animated by a grateful Hospitality
to his Friends, <i>Dogget</i> was ruffled into a
Storm, and look'd upon this Generosity as so much
Insult and Injustice upon himself and the Fraternity.
During this Disorder I stood by, a seeming
quiet Passenger, and, since talking to the Winds I
knew could be to no great Purpose (whatever Weakness
it might be call'd) could not help smiling to
observe with what officious Ease and Delight <i>Wilks</i>
was treating his Friends at our Expence, who were
scarce acquainted with them: For it seems all this
was to end in their having a Benefit-Play in the
Height of the Season, for the unprofitable Service
they had done us without our Consent or Desire to
employ them. Upon this <i>Dogget</i> bounc'd and grew
almost as untractable as <i>Wilks</i> himself. Here, again,
I was forc'd to clap my Patience to the Helm to
weather this difficult Point between them: Applying
myself therefore to the Person I imagin'd was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
likely to hear me, I desired <i>Dogget</i> "to consider that
I must naturally be as much hurt by this vain and
over-bearing Behaviour in <i>Wilks</i> as he could be;
and that tho' it was true these Actors had no Pretence
to the Favour design'd them, yet we could
not say they had done us any farther Harm, than
letting the Town see the Parts they had been
shewn in, had been better done by those to whom
they properly belong'd: Yet as we had greatly
profited by the extraordinary Labour of <i>Wilks</i>, who
acted long Parts almost every Day, and at least
twice to <i>Dogget</i>'s once;<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and that I granted it
might not be so much his Consideration of our
common Interest, as his Fondness for Applause,
that set him to Work, yet even that Vanity, if he
supposed it such, had its Merit to us; and as we
had found our Account in it, it would be Folly
upon a Punctilio to tempt the Rashness of a Man,
who was capable to undo all he had done, by any
Act of Extravagance that might fly into his Head:
That admitting this Benefit might be some little
Loss to us, yet to break with him upon it could not
but be ten times of worse Consequence, than our
overlooking his disagreeable manner of making the
Demand upon us."</p>

<p>Though I found this had made <i>Dogget</i> drop the
Severity of his Features, yet he endeavoured still to
seem uneasy, by his starting a new Objection, which
was, That we could not be sure even of the Charge
they were to pay for it: For <i>Wilks</i>, said he, you
know, will go any Lengths to make it a good Day to
them, and may whisper the Door-keepers to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
them the Ready-money taken, and return the Account
in such Tickets only as these Actors have not
themselves disposed of. To make this easy too, I
gave him my Word to be answerable for the Charge
my self. Upon this he acceded, and accordingly they
had the Benefit-Play. But so it happen'd (whether
as <i>Dogget</i> had suspected or not, I cannot say) the
Ready-money receiv'd fell Ten Pounds short of the
Sum they had agreed to pay for it. Upon the <i>Saturday</i>
following, (the Day on which we constantly made
up our Accounts) I went early to the Office, and
inquired if the Ten Pounds had yet been paid in;
but not hearing that one Shilling of it had found its
way thither, I immediately supply'd the Sum out of
my own Pocket, and directed the Treasurer to charge
it received from me in the deficient Receipt of the
Benefit-Day. Here, now, it might be imagined, all
this silly Matter was accommodated, and that no one
could so properly say he was aggrieved as myself:
But let us observe what the Consequence says&mdash;why,
the Effect of my insolent interposing honesty prov'd
to be this: That the Party most oblig'd was the most
offended; and the Offence was imputed to me who
had been Ten Pounds out of Pocket to be able to
commit it: For when <i>Wilks</i> found in the Account
how spitefully the Ten Pounds had been paid in, he
took me aside into the adjacent Stone-Passage, and
with some Warmth ask'd me, What I meant by pretending
to pay in this Ten Pounds? And that, for his
part, he did not understand such Treatment. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
which I reply'd, That tho' I was amaz'd at his
thinking himself ill-treated, I would give him a plain,
justifiable Answer.&mdash;&mdash;That I had given my Word
to <i>Dogget</i> the Charge of the Benefit should be fully
paid, and since his Friends had neglected it, I found
myself bound to make it good. Upon which he told
me I was mistaken if I thought he did not see into
the bottom of all this&mdash;That <i>Dogget</i> and I were
always endeavouring to thwart and make him uneasy;
but he was able to stand upon his own Legs, and we
should find he would not be used so: That he took
this Payment of the Ten Pounds as an Insult upon
him and a Slight to his Friends; but rather than
suffer it he would tear the whole Business to pieces:
That I knew it was in his Power to do it; and if he
could not do a civil thing to a Friend without all
this senseless Rout about it, he could be received in
<i>Ireland</i> upon his own Terms, and could as easily
mend a Company there as he had done here: That
if he were gone, <i>Dogget</i> and I would not be able to
keep the Doors open a Week; and, by G&mdash;, he
would not be a Drudge for nothing. As I knew all
this was but the Foam of the high Value he had set
upon himself, I thought it not amiss to seem a little
silently concerned, for the helpless Condition to
which his Resentment of the Injury I have related
was going to reduce us: For I knew I had a Friend
in his Heart that, if I gave him a little time to cool,
would soon bring him to Reason: The sweet Morsel
of a Thousand Pounds a Year was not to be met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
with at every Table, and might tempt a nicer Palate
than his own to swallow it, when he was not out of
Humour. This I knew would always be of weight
with him, when the best Arguments I could use
would be of none. I therefore gave him no farther
Provocation than by gravely telling him, We all had
it in our Power to do one another a Mischief; but I
believed none of us much cared to hurt ourselves;
that if he was not of my Opinion, it would not be in
my Power to hinder whatever new Scheme he might
resolve upon; that <i>London</i> would always have a
Play-house, and I should have some Chance in it,
tho' it might not be so good as it had been; that he
might be sure, if I had thought my paying in the
Ten Pounds could have been so ill received, I should
have been glad to have saved it. Upon this he
seem'd to mutter something to himself, and walk'd
off as if he had a mind to be alone. I took the
Occasion, and return'd to <i>Dogget</i> to finish our Accounts.
In about six Minutes <i>Wilks</i> came in to us,
not in the best Humour, it may be imagined; yet
not in so ill a one but that he took his Share of the
Ten Pounds without shewing the least Contempt of
it; which, had he been proud enough to have refused,
or to have paid in himself, I might have thought he
intended to make good his Menaces, and that the
Injury I had done him would never have been
forgiven; but it seems we had different ways of
thinking.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>
<p>Of this kind, more or less delightful, was the Life
I led with this impatient Man for full twenty Years.
<i>Dogget</i>, as we shall find, could not hold it so long;
but as he had more Money than I, he had not Occasion
for so much Philosophy. And thus were our
Theatrical Affairs frequently disconcerted by this
irascible Commander, this <i>Achilles</i> of our Confederacy,
who, I may be bold to say, came very little
short of the Spirit <i>Horace</i> gives to that Hero in his&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><i>Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer.</i><a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>This, then, is one of those Personal Anecdotes of our
Variances, which, as our publick Performances were
affected by it, could not, with regard to Truth and
Justice, be omitted.</p>

<p>From this time to the Year 1712 my Memory
(from which Repository alone every Article of what
I write is collected) has nothing worth mentioning,
'till the first acting of the Tragedy of <i>Cato</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> As to
the Play itself, it might be enough to say, That the
Author and the Actors had their different Hopes of
Fame and Profit amply answer'd by the Performance;
but as its Success was attended with remarkable
Consequences, it may not be amiss to trace it from
its several Years Concealment in the Closet, to the
Stage.</p>

<p>In 1703, nine Years before it was acted, I had the
Pleasure of reading the first four Acts (which was
all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span> it then written) privately with Sir <i>Richard
Steele</i>: It may be needless to say it was impossible
to lay them out of my Hand 'till I had gone thro'
them, or to dwell upon the Delight his Friendship to
the Author receiv'd upon my being so warmly pleas'd
with them: But my Satisfaction was as highly disappointed
when he told me, Whatever Spirit Mr.
<i>Addison</i> had shewn in his writing it, he doubted he
would never have Courage enough to let his <i>Cato</i>
stand the Censure of an <i>English</i> Audience; that it
had only been the Amusement of his leisure Hours
in <i>Italy</i>, and was never intended for the Stage. This
Poetical Diffidence<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Sir <i>Richard</i> himself spoke of
with some Concern, and in the Transport of his
Imagination could not help saying, <i>Good God! what
a Part would </i>Betterton<i> make of </i>Cato! But this
was seven Years before <i>Betterton</i> died, and when
<i>Booth</i> (who afterwards made his Fortune by acting
it) was in his Theatrical Minority. In the latter end
of Queen <i>Anne</i>'s Reign, when our National Politicks
had changed Hands, the Friends of Mr. <i>Addison</i>
then thought it a proper time to animate the Publick
with the Sentiments of <i>Cato</i>; in a word, their Importunities
were too warm to be resisted; and it was
no sooner finish'd than hurried to the Stage, in <i>April</i>,
1712,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> at a time when three Days a Week were
usually appointed for the Benefit Plays of particular
Actors: But a Work of that critical Importance was
to make its way through all private Considerations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
nor could it possibly give place to a Custom, which
the Breach of could very little prejudice the Benefits,
that on so unavoidable an Occasion were (in part,
tho' not wholly) postpon'd; it was therefore (<i>Mondays</i>
excepted) acted every Day for a Month to constantly
crowded Houses.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> As the Author had made us a
Present of whatever Profits he might have claim'd
from it, we thought our selves oblig'd to spare no
Cost in the proper Decorations of it. Its coming so
late in the Season to the Stage prov'd of particular
Advantage to the sharing Actors, because the Harvest
of our annual Gains was generally over before
the middle of <i>March</i>, many select Audiences being
then usually reserv'd in favour to the Benefits of
private Actors; which fixt Engagements naturally
abated the Receipts of the Days before and after
them: But this unexpected Aftercrop of <i>Cato</i> largely
supplied to us those Deficiencies, and was almost
equal to two fruitful Seasons in the same Year; at
the Close of which the three menaging Actors found
themselves each a Gainer of thirteen hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
fifty Pounds: But to return to the first Reception of
this Play from the Publick.</p>

<p>Although <i>Cato</i> seems plainly written upon what
are called <i>Whig</i> Principles, yet the <i>Torys</i> of that
time had Sense enough not to take it as the least
Reflection upon their Administration; but, on the
contrary, they seem'd to brandish and vaunt their
Approbation of every Sentiment in favour of Liberty,
which, by a publick Act of their Generosity, was
carried so high, that one Day, while the Play was
acting, they collected fifty Guineas in the Boxes,
and made a Present of them to <i>Booth</i>, with this
Compliment&mdash;&mdash;<i>For his honest Opposition to a perpetual
Dictator, and his dying so bravely in the Cause
of Liberty</i>: What was insinuated by any Part of
these Words is not my Affair;<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> but so publick a
Reward had the Appearance of a laudable Spirit,
which only such a Play as <i>Cato</i> could have inspired;
nor could <i>Booth</i> be blam'd if, upon so particular a
Distinction of his Merit, he began himself to set
more Value upon it: How far he might carry it, in
making use of the Favour he stood in with a certain
Nobleman<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> then in Power at Court, was not difficult
to penetrate, and indeed ought always to have
been expected by the menaging Actors: For which
of them (making the Case every way his own) could
with such Advantages have contented himself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
humble Station of an hired Actor? But let us see
how the Menagers stood severally affected upon this
Occasion.</p>

<p><i>Dogget</i>, who expected, though he fear'd not, the
Attempt of what after happen'd, imagin'd he had
thought of an Expedient to prevent it: And to cover
his Design with all the Art of a Statesman, he insinuated
to us (for he was a staunch <i>Whig</i>) that this
Present of fifty Guineas was a sort of a <i>Tory</i>
Triumph which they had no Pretence to; and that
for his Part he could not bear that so redoubted a
Champion for Liberty as <i>Cato</i> should be bought off
to the Cause of a Contrary Party: He therefore, in
the seeming Zeal of his Heart, proposed that the
Menagers themselves should make the same Present
to <i>Booth</i> which had been made him from the Boxes
the Day before. This, he said, would recommend
the Equality and liberal Spirit of our Menagement
to the Town, and might be a Means to secure
<i>Booth</i> more firmly in our Interest, it never having
been known that the Skill of the best Actor had
receiv'd so round a Reward or Gratuity in one Day
before. <i>Wilks</i>, who wanted nothing but Abilities to
be as cunning as <i>Dogget</i>, was so charm'd with the
Proposal that he long'd that Moment to make <i>Booth</i>
the Present with his own Hands; and though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
knew he had no Right to do it without my Consent,
had no Patience to ask it; upon which I turned to
<i>Dogget</i> with a cold Smile, and told him, that if <i>Booth</i>
could be purchas'd at so cheap a Rate, it would be
one of the best Proofs of his Oeconomy we had ever
been beholden to: I therefore desired we might have
a little Patience; that our doing it too hastily might
be only making sure of an Occasion to throw the
fifty Guineas away; for if we should be obliged to
do better for him, we could never expect that <i>Booth</i>
would think himself bound in Honour to refund
them. This seem'd so absurd an Argument to <i>Wilks</i>
that he began, with his usual Freedom of Speech, to
treat it as a pitiful Evasion of their intended Generosity:
But <i>Dogget</i>, who was not so wide of my
Meaning, clapping his Hand upon mine, said, with
an Air of Security, O! don't trouble yourself! there
must be two Words to that Bargain; let me alone to
menage that Matter. <i>Wilks</i>, upon this dark Discourse,
grew uneasy, as if there were some Secret
between us that he was to be left out of. Therefore,
to avoid the Shock of his Intemperance, I was
reduc'd to tell him that it was my Opinion, that <i>Booth</i>
would never be made easy by any thing we could do
for him, 'till he had a Share in the Profits and
Menagement; and that, as he did not want Friends
to assist him, whatever his Merit might be before,
every one would think, since his acting of <i>Cato</i>, he
had now enough to back his Pretensions to it. To
which <i>Dogget</i> reply'd, that nobody could t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>hink his
Merit was slighted by so handsome a Present as
fifty Guineas; and that, for his farther Pretensions,
whatever the License might avail, our Property of
House, Scenes, and Cloaths were our own, and not
in the Power of the Crown to dispose of. To conclude,
my Objections that the Money would be only
thrown away, <i>&amp;c.</i> were over-rul'd, and the same
Night <i>Booth</i> had the fifty Guineas, which he receiv'd
with a Thankfulness that made <i>Wilks</i> and <i>Dogget</i>
perfectly easy, insomuch that they seem'd for some
time to triumph in their Conduct, and often endeavour'd
to laugh my Jealousy out of Countenance:
But in the following Winter the Game happen'd to
take a different Turn; and then, if it had been a
laughing Matter, I had as strong an Occasion to
smile at their former Security. But before I make
an End of this Matter, I cannot pass over the good
Fortune of the Company that followed us to the Act
at <i>Oxford</i>, which was held in the intervening Summer:
Perhaps, too, a short View of the Stage in that different
Situation may not be unacceptable to the
Curious.</p>

<p>After the Restoration of King <i>Charles</i>, before the
<i>Cavalier</i> and <i>Round-head</i> Parties, under their new
Denomination of <i>Whig</i> and <i>Tory</i>, began again to be
politically troublesome, publick Acts at <i>Oxford</i> (as I
find by the Date of several Prologues written by
<i>Dryden</i><a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> for <i>Hart</i> on those Occasions) had been
more frequently held than in later Reigns. Whether
the same Party-Dissentions may have occasion'd the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Discontinuance of them, is a Speculation not necessary
to be enter'd into. But these Academical Jubilees
have usually been look'd upon as a kind of congratulatory
Compliment to the Accession of every new
Prince to the Throne, and generally, as such, have
attended them. King <i>James</i>,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> notwithstanding his
Religion, had the Honour of it; at which the Players,
as usual, assisted. This I have only mention'd to
give the Reader a Theatrical Anecdote of a Liberty
which <i>Tony Leigh</i> the Comedian took with the
Character of the well known <i>Obadiah Walker</i>,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> then
Head of <i>University College</i>, who in that Prince's
Reign had turn'd <i>Roman Catholick</i>: The Circumstance
is this.</p>

<p>In the latter End of the Comedy call'd the <i>Committee</i>,
<i>Leigh</i>, who acted the Part of <i>Teague</i>, hauling
in <i>Obadiah</i> with an Halter about his Neck, whom,
according to his written Part, he was to threaten to
hang for no better Reason than his refusing to drink
the King's Health, (but here <i>Leigh</i>) to justify his
Purpose with a stronger Provocation, put himself
into a more than ordinary Heat with his Captive
<i>Obadiah</i>, which having heightened his Master's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span> Curiosity
to know what <i>Obadiah</i> had done to deserve
such Usage, <i>Leigh</i>, folding his Arms, with a ridiculous
Stare of Astonishment, reply'd&mdash;<i>Upon my
Shoule, he has shange his Religion</i>. As the Merit of
this Jest lay chiefly in the Auditors' sudden Application
of it to the <i>Obadiah</i> of <i>Oxford</i>, it was received
with all the Triumph of Applause which the Zeal of
a different Religion could inspire. But <i>Leigh</i> was
given to understand that the King was highly displeased
at it, inasmuch as it had shewn him that the
University was in a Temper to make a Jest of his
Proselyte. But to return to the Conduct of our own
Affairs there in 1712.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>It had been a Custom for the Comedians while
at <i>Oxford</i> to act twice a Day; the first Play ending
every Morning before the College Hours of dining,
and the other never to break into the time of shutting
their Gates in the Evening. This extraordinary
Labour gave all the hired Actors a Title to double
Pay, which, at the Act in King <i>William</i>'s Time, I
had myself accordingly received there. But the present
Menagers considering that, by acting only once
a Day, their Spirits might be fresher for every single
Performance, and that by this Means they might be
able to fill up the Term of their Residence, without
the Repetition of their best and strongest Plays; and
as their Theatre was contrived to hold a full third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
more than the usual Form of it had done, one House
well fill'd might answer the Profits of two but moderately
taken up: Being enabled, too, by their late
Success at <i>London</i>, to make the Journey pleasant
and profitable to the rest of their Society, they resolved
to continue to them their double Pay, notwithstanding
this new Abatement of half their
Labour. This Conduct of the Menagers more than
answered their Intention, which was rather to get
nothing themselves than not let their Fraternity be
the better for the Expedition. Thus they laid an
Obligation upon their Company, and were themselves
considerably, though unexpected, Gainers by
it. But my chief Reason for bringing the Reader
to <i>Oxford</i> was to shew the different Taste of Plays
there from that which prevail'd at <i>London</i>. A great
deal of that false, flashy Wit and forc'd Humour,
which had been the Delight of our Metropolitan
Multitude, was only rated there at its bare intrinsick
Value;<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Applause was not to be purchased there
but by the true Sterling, the <i>Sal Atticum</i> of a
Genius, unless where the Skill of the Actor pass'd it
upon them with some extraordinary Strokes of
Nature. <i>Shakespear</i> and <i>Johnson</i> had t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>here a sort
of classical Authority; for whose masterly Scenes
they seem'd to have as implicit a Reverence as formerly
for the Ethicks of <i>Aristotle</i>; and were as
incapable of allowing Moderns to be their Competitors,
as of changing their Academical Habits for
gaudy Colours or Embroidery. Whatever Merit,
therefore, some few of our more politely-written
Comedies might pretend to, they had not the same
Effect upon the Imagination there, nor were received
with that extraordinary Applause they had met with
from the People of Mode and Pleasure in <i>London</i>,
whose vain Accomplishments did not dislike themselves
in the Glass that was held to them: The
elegant Follies of higher Life were not at <i>Oxford</i>
among their Acquaintance, and consequently might
not be so good Company to a learned Audience as
Nature, in her plain Dress and unornamented, in her
Pursuits and Inclinations seem'd to be.</p>

<p>The only distinguish'd Merit allow'd to any
modern Writer<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> was to the Author of <i>Cato</i>, which
Play being the Flower of a Plant raised in that
learned Garden, (for there Mr. <i>Addison</i> had his
Education) what favour may we not suppose was due
to him from an Audience of Brethren, who from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
that local Relation to him might naturally have a
warmer Pleasure in their Benevolence to his Fame?
But not to give more Weight to this imaginary Circumstance
than it may bear, the Fact was, that on
our first Day of acting it our House was in a manner
invested, and Entrance demanded by twelve a Clock
at Noon, and before one it was not wide enough for
many who came too late for Places. The same
Crowds continued for three Days together, (an
uncommon Curiosity in that Place) and the Death of
<i>Cato</i> triumph'd over the Injuries of <i>C√¶sar</i> every
where. To conclude, our Reception at <i>Oxford</i>, whatever
our Merit might be, exceeded our Expectation.
At our taking Leave we had the Thanks of the
Vice-Chancellor for the Decency and Order observ'd
by our whole Society, an Honour which had not
always been paid upon the same Occasions; for at
the Act in King <i>William</i>'s Time I remember some
Pranks of a different Nature had been complain'd of.
Our Receipts had not only enabled us (as I have
observ'd) to double the Pay of every Actor, but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>to
afford out of them towards the Repair of St <i>Mary</i>'s
Church the Contribution of fifty Pounds: Besides
which, each of the three Menagers had to his respective
Share, clear of all Charges, one hundred and
fifty more for his one and twenty Day's Labour,
which being added to his thirteen hundred and fifty
shared in the Winter preceding, amounted in the
whole to fifteen hundred, the greatest Sum ever
known to have been shared in one Year to that
Time: And to the Honour of our Auditors here and
elsewhere be it spoken, all this was rais'd without the
Aid of those barbarous Entertainments with which,
some few Years after (upon the Re-establishment of
two contending Companies) we were forc'd to disgrace
the Stage to support it.</p>

<p>This, therefore, is that remarkable Period when
the Stage, during my Time upon it, was the least
reproachable: And it may be worth the publick
Observation (if any thing I have said of it can be
so) that <i>One</i> Stage may, as I have prov'd it has done,
very laudably support it self by such Spectacles only
as are fit to delight a sensible People; but the equal
Prosperity of <i>Two</i> Stages has always been of a very
short Duration. If therefore the Publick should ever
recover into the true Taste of that Time, and stick
to it, the Stage must come into it, or <i>starve</i>; as,
whenever the general Taste is vulgar, the Stage must
come down to it to <i>live</i>.&mdash;&mdash;But I ask Pardon of
the Multitude, who, in all Regulations of the Stage,
may expect to be a little indulg'd in what they like:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
If therefore they <i>will</i> have a May-pole, why, the
Players must <i>give</i> them a May-pole; but I only speak
in case they should keep an old Custom of changing
their Minds, and by their Privilege of being in the
<i>wrong</i>, should take a Fancy, by way of Variety, of
being in the <i>right</i>&mdash;&mdash;Then, in such a Case, what I
have said may appear to have been no intended Design
against their Liberty of judging for themselves.</p>

<p>After our Return from <i>Oxford</i>, <i>Booth</i> was at full
Leisure to solicit his Admission to a Share in the
Menagement,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> in which he succeeded about the
Beginning of the following Winter: Accordingly a
new License (recalling all former Licenses) was
issued, wherein <i>Booth</i>'s Name was added to those of
the other Menagers.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> But still there was a Difficulty
in his Qualification to be adjusted; what Consideration
he should allow for an equal Title to our Stock
of Cloaths, Scenes, <i>&amp;c.</i> without which the License
was of no more use than the Stock was without the
License; or, at least, if there were any Difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>,
the former Menagers seem'd to have the Advantage
in it; the Stock being intirely theirs, and three Parts
in four of the License; for <i>Collier</i>, though now but
a fifth Menager, still insisted on his former Appointment
of 700<i>l.</i> a Year, which in Equity ought certainly
to have been proportionably abated: But
Court-Favour was not always measur'd by <i>that</i>
Yard; <i>Collier's</i> Matter was soon out of the Question;
his Pretensions were too visible to be contested;
but the Affair of <i>Booth</i> was not so clear a
Point: The Lord Chamberlain, therefore, only recommended
it to be adjusted among our selves;
which, to say the Truth, at that Time was a greater
Indulgence than I expected. Let us see, then, how
this critical Case was handled.</p>

<p><i>Wilks</i> was of Opinion, that to set a good round
Value upon our Stock, was the only way to come
near an Equivalent for the Diminution of our Shares,
which the Admission of <i>Booth</i> must occasion: But
<i>Dogget</i> insisted that he had no mind to dispose of
any Part of his Property, and therefore would set no
Price upon it at all. Though I allow'd that Both
these Opinions might be grounded on a good deal
of Equity, yet I was not sure that either of them was
practicable; and therefore told them, that when they
could Both agree which of them could be made so,
they might rely on my Consent in any Shape. In
the mean time I desired they would consider, that
as our License subsisted only during Pleasure, we
could not pretend that the Queen might not recal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>l or
alter it: But that to speak out, without mincing the
matter on either Side, the Truth was plainly this:
That <i>Booth</i> had a manifest Merit as an Actor; and as
he was not supposed to be a <i>Whig</i>, it was as evident
that a good deal for that Reason a Secretary of State
had taken him into his Protection, which I was afraid
the weak Pretence of our invaded Property would
not be able to contend with: That his having signaliz'd
himself in the Character of <i>Cato</i> (whose Principles
the <i>Tories</i> had affected to have taken into
their own Possession) was a very popular Pretence of
making him free of the Stage, by advancing him to
the Profits of it. And, as we had seen that the Stage
was frequently treated as if it was not suppos'd to
have any Property at all, this Favour intended to
<i>Booth</i> was thought a right Occasion to avow that
Opinion by disposing of its Property at Pleasure:
But be that as it might, I own'd it was not so much
my Apprehensions of what the <i>Court</i> might do, that
sway'd me into an Accommodation with <i>Booth</i>, as
what the <i>Town</i>, (in whose Favour he now apparently
stood) might think <i>ought</i> to be done: That there
might be more danger in contesting their arbitrary
Will and Pleasure than in disputing this less terrible
Strain of the Prerogative. That if <i>Booth</i> were only
impos'd upon us from his Merit to the Court, we were
then in the Condition of other Subjects: Then,
indeed, Law, Right, and Possession might have a
tolerable Tug for our Property: But as the Town
would always look upon his Merit to <i>them</i> in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
stronger Light, and be Judges of it themselves, it
would be a weak and idle Endeavour in us not to
sail with the Stream, when we might possibly make a
Merit of our cheerfully admitting him: That though
his former Opposition to our Interest might, between
Man and Man, a good deal justify our not making an
earlier Friend of him; yet that was a Disobligation
out of the Town's Regard, and consequently would
be of no weight against so approv'd an Actor's being
preferr'd. But all this notwithstanding, if they could
both agree in a different Opinion, I would, at the
Hazard of any Consequence, be guided by it.</p>

<p>Here, now, will be shewn another Instance of our
different Tempers: <i>Dogget</i> (who, in all Matters that
concern'd our common Weal and Interest, little regarded
our Opinion, and even to an Obstinacy walk'd
by his own) look'd only out of Humour at what I had
said, and, without thinking himself oblig'd to give
any Reason for it, declar'd he would maintain his
Property. <i>Wilks</i> (who, upon the same Occasions,
was as remarkably ductile, as when his Superiority
on the Stage was in question he was assuming and
intractable) said, for his Part, provided our Business
of acting was not interrupted, he did not care what
we did: But, in short, he was for playing on, come
what would of it. This last Part of his Declaration
I did not dislike, and therefore I desir'd we might
all enter into an immediate Treaty with <i>Booth</i>, upon
the Terms of his Admission. <i>Dogget</i> still sullenly
reply'd, that he had no Occasion to enter into any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Treaty. <i>Wilks</i> then, to soften him, propos'd that, if
I liked it, <i>Dogget</i> might undertake it himself. I
agreed. No! he would not be concern'd in it. I then
offer'd the same Trust to <i>Wilks</i>, if <i>Dogget</i> approv'd
of it. <i>Wilks</i> said he was not good at making of
Bargains, but if I was willing, he would rather leave
it to me. <i>Dogget</i> at this rose up and said, we might
both do as we pleas'd, but that nothing but the Law
should make him part with his Property&mdash;and so
went out of the Room. After which he never came
among us more, either as an Actor or Menager.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>By his having in this abrupt manner abdicated his
Post in our Government, what he left of it naturally
devolv'd upon <i>Wilks</i> and myself. However, this
did not so much distress our Affair as I have Reason
to believe <i>Dogget</i> thought it would: For though by
our Indentures tripartite we could not dispose of his
Property without his Consent; Yet those Indentures
could not oblige us to fast because he had no
Appetite; and if the Mill did not grind, we could
have no Bread: We therefore determin'd, at any
Hazard, to keep our Business still going, and that
our safest way would be to make the best Bargain
we could with <i>Booth</i>; one Article of which was to
be, That <i>Booth</i> should stand equally answerable with
us to <i>Dogget</i> for the Consequence: To which <i>Booth</i>
made no Objection, and the rest of his Agreement
was to allow us Six Hundred Pounds for his Share
in our Property, which was to be paid by such Sums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
as should arise from half his Profits of Acting, 'till
the whole was discharg'd: Yet so cautious were we
in this Affair, that this Agreement was only Verbal
on our Part, tho' written and sign'd by <i>Booth</i> as
what intirely contented him: However, Bond and
Judgment could not have made it more secure to
him; for he had his Share, and was able to discharge
the Incumbrance upon it by his Income of that Year
only. Let us see what <i>Dogget</i> did in this Affair after
he had left us.</p>

<p>Might it not be imagin'd that <i>Wilks</i> and Myself,
by having made this Matter easy to <i>Booth</i>, should
have deserv'd the Approbation at least, if not the
Favour of the Court that had exerted so much Power
to prefer him? But shall I be believed when I
affirm that <i>Dogget</i>, who had so strongly oppos'd the
Court in his Admission to a Share, was very near
getting the better of us both upon that Account, and
for some time appeared to have more Favour there
than either of us? Let me tell out my Story, and
then think what you please of it.</p>

<p><i>Dogget</i>, who was equally oblig'd with us to act
upon the Stage, as to assist in the Menagement of
it, tho' he had refus'd to do either, still demanded of
us his whole Share of the Profits, without considering
what Part of them <i>Booth</i> might pretend to from our
late Concessions. After many fruitless Endeavours
to bring him back to us, <i>Booth</i> join'd with us in
making him an Offer of half a Share if he had a
mind totally to quit the Stage, and make it a <i>Sine-cu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>re</i>.
No! he wanted the whole, and to sit still
himself, while we (if we pleased) might work for him
or let it alone, and none of us all, neither he nor we,
be the better for it. What we imagin'd encourag'd
him to hold us at this short Defiance was, that he
had laid up enough to live upon without the Stage
(for he was one of those close Oeconomists whom
Prodigals call a Miser) and therefore, partly from an
Inclination as an invincible <i>Whig</i> to signalize himself
in defence of his Property, and as much presuming
that our Necessities would oblige us to come
to his own Terms, he was determin'd (even against
the Opinion of his Friends) to make no other Peace
with us. But not being able by this inflexible Perseverance
to have his wicked Will of us, he was
resolv'd to go to the Fountain-head of his own
Distress, and try if from thence he could turn the
Current against us. He appeal'd to the Vice-Chamberlain,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
to whose Direction the adjusting of all these
Theatrical Difficulties was then committed: But
there, I dare say, the Reader does not expect he
should meet with much Favour: However, be that
as it may; for whether any regard was had to his
having some Thousands in his Pocket; or that he
was consider'd as a Man who would or could make
more Noise in the Matter than Courtiers might care
for: Or what Charms, Spells, or Conjurations he
might make use of, is all Darkness to me; yet so it
was, he one way or other play'd his part so wel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>l, that
in a few Days after we received an Order from the
Vice-Chamberlain, positively commanding us to pay
<i>Dogget</i> his whole Share, notwithstanding we had
complain'd before of his having withdrawn himself
from acting on the Stage, and from the Menagement
of it. This I thought was a dainty Distinction,
indeed! that <i>Dogget</i>'s Defiance of the Commands in
favour of <i>Booth</i> should be rewarded with so ample
a <i>Sine-cure</i>, and that we for our Obedience should
be condemn'd to dig in the Mine to pay it him!
This bitter Pill, I confess, was more than I could
down with, and therefore soon determin'd at all
Events never to take it. But as I had a Man in Power
to deal with, it was not my business to speak <i>out</i> to
him, or to set forth our Treatment in its proper
Colours. My only Doubt was, Whether I could bring
<i>Wilks</i> into the same Sentiments (for he never car'd
to litigate any thing that did not affect his Figure
upon the Stage.) But I had the good Fortune to
lay our Condition in so precarious and disagreeable
a Light to him, if we submitted to this Order, that
he fir'd before I could get thro' half the Consequences
of it; and I began now to find it more difficult to
keep him within Bounds than I had before to alarm
him. I then propos'd to him this Expedient: That
we should draw up a Remonstrance, neither seeming
to refuse or comply with this Order; but to start
such Objections and perplexing Difficulties that
should make the whole impracticable: That under
such Distractions as this would raise in our Affa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>irs
we could not be answerable to keep open our Doors,
which consequently would destroy the Fruit of the
Favour lately granted to <i>Booth</i>, as well as of This
intended to <i>Dogget</i> himself. To this Remonstrance
we received an Answer in Writing, which varied
something in the Measures to accommodate Matters
with <i>Dogget</i>. This was all I desir'd; when I found
the Style of <i>Sic jubeo</i> was alter'd, when this formidable
Power began to <i>parley</i> with us, we knew
there could not be much to be fear'd from it: For I
would have remonstrated 'till I had died, rather than
have yielded to the roughest or smoothest Persuasion,
that could intimidate or deceive us. By this
Conduct we made the Affair at last too troublesome
for the Ease of a Courtier to go thro' with. For
when it was consider'd that the principal Point, the
Admission of <i>Booth</i>, was got over, <i>Dogget</i> was fairly
left to the Law for Relief.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Upon this Disappointment <i>Dogget</i> accordingly
preferred a Bill in <i>Chancery</i> against us. <i>Wilks</i>,
who hated all Business but that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>of entertaining the
Publick, left the Conduct of our Cause to me; in
which we had, at our first setting out, this Advantage
of <i>Dogget</i>, that we had three Pockets to support our
Expence, where he had but One. My first Direction
to our Solicitor was, to use all possible Delay
that the Law would admit of, a Direction that
Lawyers seldom neglect; by this means we hung up
our Plaintiff about two Years in <i>Chancery</i>, 'till we
were at full Leisure to come to a Hearing before the
Lord-Chancellor <i>Cooper</i>, which did not happen 'till
after the Accession of his late Majesty. The Issue
of it was this. <i>Dogget</i> had about fourteen Days
allow'd him to make his Election whether he would
return to act as usual: But he declaring, by his
Counsel, That he rather chose to quit the Stage, he
was decreed Six Hundred Pounds for his Share in
our Property, with 15 <i>per Cent.</i> Interest f<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>rom the
Date of the last License: Upon the Receipt of which
both Parties were to sign General-Releases, and
severally to pay their own Costs. By this Decree,
<i>Dogget</i>, when his Lawyer's Bill was paid, scarce got
one Year's Purchase of what we had offer'd him
without Law, which (as he surviv'd but seven Years
after it) would have been an Annuity of Five
Hundred Pounds and a <i>Sine Cure</i> for Life.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Tho' there are many Persons living who know
every Article of these Facts to be true: Yet it will
be found that the strongest of them was not the
strongest Occasion of <i>Dogget</i>'s quitting the Stage.
If therefore the Reader should not have Curiosity
enough to know how the Publick came to be depriv'd
of so valuable an Actor, let him consider that he is not
obliged to go through the rest of this Chapter, which
I fairly tell him before-hand will only be fill'd up with
a few idle Anecdotes leading to that Discovery.</p>

<p>After our Law-suit was ended, <i>Dogget</i> for some
few Years could scarce bear the Sight of <i>Wilks</i> or
myself; tho' (as shall be shewn) for different Reasons:
Yet it was his Misfortune to meet with us almost
every Day. <i>Button</i>'s Coffee-house, so celebrated in
the <i>Tatlers</i> for the Good-Company that came there,
was at this time in its highest Request. <i>Addison</i>,
<i>Steele</i>, <i>Pope</i>, and several other Gentlemen of different
Merit, then made it their constant <i>Rendezvous</i>. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
could <i>Dogget</i> decline the agreeable Conversation
there, tho' he was daily sure to find <i>Wilks</i> or myself
in the same Place to sour his Share of it: For as
<i>Wilks</i> and He were differently Proud, the one rejoicing
in a captious, over-bearing, valiant Pride, and the
other in a stiff, sullen, Purse-Pride, it may be easily
conceiv'd, when two such Tempers met, how agreeable
the Sight of one was to the other. And as <i>Dogget</i>
knew I had been the Conductor of our Defence
against his Law-suit, which had hurt him more for
the Loss he had sustain'd in his Reputation of
understanding Business, which he valued himself
upon, than his Disappointment had of getting so
little by it; it was no wonder if I was intirely out of
his good Graces, which I confess I was inclin'd upon
any reasonable Terms to have recover'd; he being
of all my Theatrical Brethren the Man I most delighted
in: For when he was not in a Fit of Wisdom,
or not over-concerned about his Interest, he had a
great deal of entertaining Humour: I therefore, notwithstanding
his Reserve, always left the Door open
to our former Intimacy, if he were inclined to come
into it. I never failed to give him my Hat and
<i>Your Servant</i> wherever I met him; neither of which
he would ever return for above a Year after; but I
still persisted in my usual Salutation, without observing
whether it was civilly received or not. This
ridiculous Silence between two Comedians, that had
so lately liv'd in a constant Course of Raillery with
one another, was often smil'd at by our Acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
who frequented the same Coffee-house: And one of
them carried his Jest upon it so far, that when I was
at some Distance from Town he wrote me a formal
Account that <i>Dogget</i> was actually dead. After the
first Surprize his Letter gave me was over, I began
to consider, that this coming from a droll Friend to
both of us, might possibly be written to extract some
Merriment out of my real belief of it: In this I was
not unwilling to gratify him, and returned an Answer
as if I had taken the Truth of his News for granted;
and was not a little pleas'd that I had so fair an
Opportunity of speaking my Mind freely of <i>Dogget</i>,
which I did, in some Favour of his Character; I excused
his Faults, and was just to his Merit. His
Law-suit with us I only imputed to his having naturally
deceived himself in the Justice of his Cause.
What I most complain'd of was, his irreconcilable
Disaffection to me upon it, whom he could not reasonably
blame for standing in my own Defence; that
not to endure me after it was a Reflection upon his
Sense, when all our Acquaintance had been Witnesses
of our former Intimacy, which my Behaviour
in his Life-time had plainly shewn him I had a mind
to renew. But since he was now gone (however
great a Churl he was to me) I was sorry my Correspondent
had lost him.</p>

<p>This Part of my Letter I was sure, if <i>Dogget</i>'s
Eyes were still open, would be shewn to him; if not, I
had only writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span> it to no Purpose. But about a Month
after, when I came to Town, I had some little Reason
to imagine it had the Effect I wish'd from it: For
one Day, sitting over-against him at the same Coffee-house
where we often mixt at the same Table, tho'
we never exchanged a single Syllable, he graciously
extended his Hand for a Pinch of my Snuff: As this
seem'd from him a sort of breaking the Ice of his
Temper, I took Courage upon it to break Silence on
my Side, and ask'd him how he lik'd it? To which,
with a slow Hesitation naturally assisted by the
Action of his taking the Snuff, he reply'd&mdash;<i>Umh!
the best&mdash;Umh!&mdash;I have tasted a great while!</i>&mdash;If the
Reader, who may possibly think all this extremely
trifling, will consider that Trifles sometimes shew Characters
in as strong a Light as Facts of more serious
Importance, I am in hopes he may allow that my
Matter less needs an Excuse than the Excuse itself
does; if not, I must stand condemn'd at the end of my
Story.&mdash;&mdash;But let me go on.</p>

<p>After a few Days of these coy, Lady-like Compliances
on his Side, we grew into a more conversable
Temper: At last I took a proper Occasion, and
desired he would be so frank with me as to let me
know what was his real Dislike, or Motive, that made
him throw up so good an Income as his Share with
us annually brought him in? For though by our
Admission of <i>Booth</i>, it might not probably amount to
so much by a Hundred or two a Year as formerly,
yet the Remainder was too considerable to be
quarrel'd with, and was likely to continue more than
the best Actors before us had ever got by the Stage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
And farther, to encourage him to be open, I told
him, If I had done any thing that had particularly
disobliged him, I was ready, if he could put me in
the way, to make him any Amends in my Power;
if not, I desired he would be so just to himself as to
let me know the real Truth without Reserve: But
Reserve he could not, from his natural Temper,
easily shake off. All he said came from him by half
Sentences and <i>Inuendos</i>, as&mdash;No, he had not taken
any thing particularly ill&mdash;for his Part, he was very
easy as he was; but where others were to dispose of
his Property as they pleas'd&mdash;if you had stood it out
as I did, <i>Booth</i> might have paid a better Price for it.&mdash;You
were too much afraid of the Court&mdash;but that's
all over.&mdash;There were other things in the Play-house.&mdash;No
Man of Spirit.&mdash;In short, to be always pester'd
and provok'd by a trifling Wasp&mdash;a&mdash;vain&mdash;shallow!&mdash;A
Man would sooner beg his Bread than bear it&mdash;(Here
it was easy to understand him: I therefore
ask'd him what he had to bear that I had not my
Share of?) No! it was not the same thing, he said.&mdash;You
can play with a Bear, or let him alone and do
what he would, but I could not let him lay his Paws
upon me without being hurt; you did not feel him as
I did.&mdash;And for a Man to be cutting of Throats upon
every Trifle at my time of Day!&mdash;If I had been as
covetous as he thought me, may be I might have born
it as well as you&mdash;but I would not be a Lord of the
Treasury if such a Temper as <i>Wilks</i>'s were to be at
the Head of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Here, then, the whole Secret was out. The rest of
our Conversation was but explaining upon it. In a
Word, the painful Behaviour of <i>Wilks</i> had hurt him
so sorely that the Affair of <i>Booth</i> was look'd upon
as much a Relief as a Grievance, in giving him so
plausible a Pretence to get rid of us all with a better
Grace.</p>

<p><i>Booth</i> too, in a little time, had his Share of the
same Uneasiness, and often complain'd of it to me:
Yet as we neither of us could then afford to pay
<i>Dogget</i>'s Price for our Remedy, all we could do was
to avoid every Occasion in our Power of inflaming
the Distemper: So that we both agreed, tho' <i>Wilks</i>'s
Nature was not to be changed, it was a less Evil to
live with him than without him.</p>

<p>Tho' I had often suspected, from what I had felt
myself, that the Temper of <i>Wilks</i> was <i>Dogget</i>'s real
Quarrel to the Stage, yet I could never thoroughly
believe it 'till I had it from his own Mouth. And I
then thought the Concern he had shewn at it was a
good deal inconsistent with that Understanding
which was generally allow'd him. When I give my
Reasons for it, perhaps the Reader will not have a
better Opinion of my own: Be that as it may, I
cannot help wondering that he who was so much
more capable of Reflexion than <i>Wilks</i>, could sacrifice
so valuable an Income to his Impatience of another's
natural Frailty! And though my Stoical way of
thinking may be no Rule for a wiser Man's Opinion,
yet, if it should happen to be right, the Reader may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
make his Use of it. Why then should we not always
consider that the Rashness of Abuse is but the false
Reason of a weak Man? and that offensive Terms
are only used to supply the want of Strength in
Argument? Which, as to the common Practice of
the sober World, we do not find every Man in Business
is oblig'd to resent with a military Sense of
Honour: Or if he should, would not the Conclusion
amount to this? Because another wants Sense and
Manners I am obliged to be a Madman: For such
every Man is, more or less, while the Passion of
Anger is in Possession of him. And what less can
we call that proud Man who would put another out
of the World only for putting him out of Humour?
If Accounts of the Tongue were always to be made
up with the Sword, all the Wisemen in the World
might be brought in Debtors to Blockheads. And
when Honour pretends to be Witness, Judge, and
Executioner in its own Cause, if Honour were a Man,
would it be an Untruth to say Honour is a very impudent
Fellow? But in <i>Dogget</i>'s Case it may be
ask'd, How was he to behave himself? Were passionate
Insults to be born for Years together? To
these Questions I can only answer with two or three
more, Was he to punish himself because another was
in the wrong? How many sensible Husbands endure
the teizing Tongue of a froward Wife only because
she is the weaker Vessel? And why should
not a weak Man have the same Indulgence? Daily
Experience will tell us that the fretful Te<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>mper
of a Friend, like the Personal Beauty of a fine
Lady, by Use and Cohabitation may be brought
down to give us neither Pain nor Pleasure. Such,
at least, and no more, was the Distress I found myself
in upon the same Provocations, which I generally
return'd with humming an Air to myself; or
if the Storm grew very high, it might perhaps
sometimes ruffle me enough to sing a little out of
Tune. Thus too (if I had any ill Nature to gratify)
I often saw the unruly Passion of the Aggressor's
Mind punish itself by a restless Disorder of the
Body.</p>

<p>What inclines me, therefore, to think the Conduct
of <i>Dogget</i> was as rash as the Provocations he complain'd
of, is that in some time after he had left us
he plainly discover'd he had repented it. His Acquaintance
observ'd to us, that he sent many a long
Look after his Share in the still prosperous State of
the Stage: But as his Heart was too high to declare
(what we saw too) his shy Inclination to return, he
made us no direct Overtures. Nor, indeed, did we
care (though he was a golden Actor) to pay too dear
for him: For as most of his Parts had been pretty
well supply'd, he could not now be of his former
Value to us. However, to shew the Town at least
that he had not forsworn the Stage, he one Day condescended
to play for the Benefit of Mrs. <i>Porter</i>,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> in
the <i>Wanton Wife</i>, at which he knew his late Majesty
was to be present.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Now (tho' I speak it not of my
own Knowledge) yet it was not likely Mrs. <i>Porte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>r</i>
would have ask'd that Favour of him without some
previous Hint that it would be granted. His coming
among us for that Day only had a strong Appearance
of his laying it in our way to make him Proposals, or
that he hoped the Court or Town might intimate to
us their Desire of seeing him oftener: But as he
acted only to do a particular Favour, the Menagers
ow'd him no Compliment for it beyond Common
Civilities. And, as that might not be all he proposed
by it, his farther Views (if he had any) came to
nothing. For after this Attempt he never returned
to the Stage.</p>

<p>To speak of him as an Actor: He was the most
an Original, and the strictest Observer of Nature, of
all his Contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> He borrow'd from none of
them: His Manner was his own: He was a Pattern
to others, whose greatest Merit was that they had
sometimes tolerably imitated him. In dressing a
Character to the greatest Exactness he was remarkably
skilful; the least Article of whatever Habit h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>e
wore seem'd in some degree to speak and mark the
different Humour he presented; a necessary Care in
a Comedian, in which many have been too remiss or
ignorant. He could be extremely ridiculous without
stepping into the least Impropriety to make him so.
His greatest Success was in Characters of lower
Life, which he improv'd from the Delight he took in
his Observations of that Kind in the real World.
In Songs, and particular Dances, too, of Humour,
he had no Competitor. <i>Congreve</i> was a great Admirer
of him, and found his Account in the Characters
he expressly wrote for him. In those of <i>Fondlewife</i>,
in his <i>Old Batchelor</i>, and <i>Ben</i>, in <i>Love for Love</i>, no
Author and Actor could be more obliged to their
mutual masterly Performances. He was very acceptable
to several Persons of high Rank and Taste:
Tho' he seldom car'd to be the Comedian but among
his more intimate Acquaintance.</p>

<p>And now let me ask the World a Question.
When Men have any valuable Qualities, why are the
generality of our modern Wits so fond of exposing
their Failings only, which the wisest of Mankind
will never wholly be free from? Is it of more use
to the Publick to know their Errors than their Perfections?
Why is the Account of Life to be so
unequally stated? Though a Man may be sometimes
Debtor to Sense or Morality, is it not doing
him Wrong not to let the World see, at the same
time, how far he may be Creditor to both? Are
Defects and Disproportions to be the only <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>labour'd
Features in a Portrait? But perhaps such Authors
may know how to please the World better than I
do, and may naturally suppose that what is delightful
to themselves may not be disagreeable to others.
For my own part, I confess myself a little touch'd in
Conscience at what I have just now observ'd to the
Disadvantage of my other Brother-Menager.</p>

<p>If, therefore, in discovering the true Cause of the
Publick's losing so valuable an Actor as <i>Dogget</i>, I
have been obliged to shew the Temper of <i>Wilks</i> in
its natural Complexion, ought I not, in amends and
Balance of his Imperfections, to say at the same time
of him, That if he was not the most Correct or Judicious,
yet (as <i>Hamlet</i> says of the King his Father)
<i>Take him</i> for <i>All in All</i>, &amp;c. he was certainly the
most diligent, most laborious, and most useful Actor
that I have seen upon the Stage in Fifty Years.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<div class="chapquot">
<p><i>Sir</i> Richard Steele <i>succeeds</i> Collier <i>in the Theatre-Royal</i>. Lincoln's-Inn-Fields
<i>House rebuilt</i>. <i>The Patent restored. Eight Actors

<p>Upon the Death of the Queen, Plays (as they
always had been on the like Occasions) were
silenc'd for six Weeks. But this happening on the
first of <i>August</i>,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> in the long Vacation of the Theatre,
the Observance of that Ceremony, which at another
Juncture would have fallen like wet Weather upon
their Harvest, did them now no particular Damage.
Their License, however, being of course to be renewed,
that Vacation gave the Menagers Time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
cast about for the better Alteration of it: And
since they knew the Pension of seven hundred a
Year, which had been levied upon them for <i>Collier</i>,
must still be paid to somebody, they imagined the
Merit of a <i>Whig</i> might now have as good a Chance
for getting into it, as that of a <i>Tory</i> had for being
continued in it: Having no Obligations, therefore,
to <i>Collier</i>, who had made the last Penny of them,
they apply'd themselves to Sir <i>Richard Steele</i>, who
had distinguished himself by his Zeal for the House
of <i>Hanover</i>, and had been expell'd the House of
Commons for carrying it (as was judg'd at a certain
Crisis) into a Reproach of the Government. This
we knew was his Pretension to that Favour in which
he now stood at Court: We knew, too, the Obligations
the Stage had to his Writings; there being
scarce a Comedian of Merit in our whole Company
whom his <i>Tatlers</i> had not made better by his publick
Recommendation of them. And many Days had
our House been particularly fill'd by the Influence
and Credit of his Pen. Obligations of this kind from
a Gentleman with whom they all had the Pleasure of
a personal Intimacy, the Menagers thought could
not be more justly return'd than by shewing him
some warm Instance of their Desire to have him at
the Head of them. We therefore beg'd him to use
his Interest for the Renewal of our License, and that
he would do us the Honour of getting our Names to
stand with His in the same Commission. This, we
told him, would put it still farther into his P<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>ower of
supporting the Stage in that Reputation, to which his
Lucubrations had already so much contributed; and
that therefore we thought no Man had better Pretences
to partake of its Success.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Though it may be no Addition to the favourable
Part of this Gentleman's Character to say with what
Pleasure he receiv'd this Mark <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>of our Inclination to
him, yet my Vanity longs to tell you that it surpriz'd
him into an Acknowledgment that People who are
shy of Obligations are cautious of confessing. His
Spirits took such a lively turn upon it, that had we
been all his own Sons, no unexpected Act of filial
Duty could have more endear'd us to him.</p>

<p>It must be observ'd, then, that as <i>Collier</i> had no
Share in any Part of our Property, no Difficulties
from that Quarter could obstruct this Proposal.
And the usual Time of our beginning to act for the
Winter-Season now drawing near, we press'd him
not to lose any Time in his Solicitation of this new
License. Accordingly Sir <i>Richard</i> apply'd himself
to the Duke of <i>Marlborough</i>, the Hero of his Heart,
who, upon the first mention of it, obtain'd it of his
Majesty for Sir <i>Richard</i> and the former Menagers
who were Actors. <i>Collier</i> we heard no more
of.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The Court and Town being crowded very early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
in the Winter-Season, upon the critical Turn of
Affairs so much expected from the <i>Hanover</i> Succession,
the Theatre had its particular Share of that
general Blessing by a more than ordinary Concourse
of Spectators.</p>

<p>About this Time the Patentee, having very near
finish'd his House in <i>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</i>, began to
think of forming a new Company; and in the mean
time found it necessary to apply for Leave to employ
them. By the weak Defence he had always made
against the several Attacks upon his Interest and
former Government of the Theatre, it might be a
Question, if his House had been ready in the Queen's
Time, whether he would then have had the Spirit to
ask, or Interest enough to obtain Leave to use it:
But in the following Reign, as it did not appear he
had done any thing to forfeit the Right of his Patent,
he prevail'd with Mr. <i>Craggs</i> the Younger (afterwards
Secretary of State) to lay his Case before the
King, which he did in so effectual a manner that (as
Mr. <i>Craggs</i> himself told me) his Majesty was pleas'd
to say upon it, "That he remember'd when he had
been in <i>England</i> before, in King <i>Charles</i> his Time,
there had been two Theatres in <i>London</i>; and as
the Patent seem'd to be a lawful Grant, he saw no
Reason why Two Play-houses might not be continued."<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>
<p>The Suspension of the Patent being thus taken
off, the younger Multitude seem'd to call aloud for
two Play-houses! Many desired another, from the
common Notion that <i>Two</i> would always create Emulation
in the Actors (an Opinion which I have consider'd
in a former Chapter). Others, too, were as
eager for them, from the natural Ill-will that follows
the Fortunate or Prosperous in any Undertaking.
Of this low Malevolence we had, now and then, had
remarkable Instances; we had been forced to dismiss
an Audience of a hundred and fifty Pounds, from a
Disturbance spirited up by obscure People, who
never gave any better Reason for it, than that it was
their Fancy to support the idle Complaint of one
rival Actress against another, in their several Pretensions
to the chief Part in a new Tragedy. But as
this Tumult seem'd only to be the Wantonness of
<i>English</i> Liberty, I shall not presume to lay any
farther Censure upon it.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Now, notwithstanding this publick Desire of reestablishing
two Houses; and though I have allow'd
the former Actors greatly our Superiors; and the
Menagers I am speaking of not to have been without
their private Errors: Yet under all these Disa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>dvantages,
it is certain the Stage, for twenty Years
before this time, had never been in so flourishing a
Condition: And it was as evident to all sensible
Spectators that this Prosperity could be only owing
to that better Order and closer Industry now daily
observ'd, and which had formerly been neglected by
our Predecessors. But that I may not impose upon
the Reader a Merit which was not generally allow'd
us, I ought honestly to let him know, that about this
time the publick Papers, particularly <i>Mist</i>'s Journal,
took upon them very often to censure our Menagement,
with the same Freedom and Severity as if we
had been so many Ministers of State: But so it
happen'd, that these unfortunate Reformers of the
World, these self-appointed <i>Censors</i>, hardly ever hit
upon what was really wrong in us; but taking up
Facts upon Trust, or Hear-say, piled up many a
pompous Paragraph that they had ingeniously conceiv'd
was sufficient to demolish our Administration,
or at least to make us very uneasy in it; which,
indeed, had so far its Effect, that my equally-injur'd
Brethren, <i>Wilks</i> and <i>Booth</i>, often complain'd to me
of these disagreeable Aspersions, and propos'd that
some publick Answer might be made to them, which
I always oppos'd by, perhaps, too secure a Contempt
of what such Writers could do to hurt us; and my
Reason for it was, that I knew but of one way to
silence Authors of that Stamp; which was, to gro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>w
insignificant and good for nothing, and then we
should hear no more of them: But while we continued
in the Prosperity of pleasing others, and were
not conscious of having deserv'd what they said of
us, why should we gratify the little Spleen of our
Enemies by wincing at it,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> or give them fresh Opportunities
to dine upon any Reply they might make to
our publickly taking Notice of them? And though
Silence might in some Cases be a sign of Guilt or
Error confess'd, our Accusers were so low in their
Credit and Sense, that the Content we gave the
Publick almost every Day from the Stage ought to
be our only Answer to them.</p>

<p>However (as I have observ'd) we made many
Blots, which these unskilful Gamesters never hit:
But the Fidelity of an Historian cannot be excus'd
the Omission of any Truth which might make for
the other Side of the Question. I shall therefore
confess a Fact, which, if a happy Accident had not
intervened, had brought our Affairs into a very tottering
Condition. This, too, is that Fact which in a
former Chapter I promis'd to set forth as a Sea-M<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>ark
of Danger to future Menagers in their Theatrical
Course of Government.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>When the new-built Theatre in <i>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</i>
was ready to be open'd, seven or eight Actors in one
Day deserted from us to the Service of the Enemy,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
which oblig'd us to postpone many of our best Plays
for want of some inferior Part in them which these
Deserters had been used to fill: But the Indulgence
of the Royal Family, who then frequently honour'd
us by their Presence, was pleas'd to accept of whatever
could be hastily got ready for their Entertainment.
And tho' this critical good Fortune prevented,
in some measure, our Audiences falling so low as otherwise
they might have done, yet it was not sufficient to
keep us in our former Prosperity: For that Year
our Profits amounted not to above a third Part of
our usual Dividends; tho' in the following Year we
intirely recover'd them. The Chief of these Deserters
were <i>Keene</i>, <i>Bullock</i>, <i>Pack</i>,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> <i>Leigh</i>, Son of the
famous <i>Tony Leigh</i>,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and others of less note. 'Tis
true, they none of them had more than a negative
Merit, in being only able to do us more Harm by
their leaving us without Notice, than they could do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
us Good by remaining with us: For though the best
of them could not support a Play, the worst of them
by their Absence could maim it; as the Loss of the
least Pin in a Watch may obstruct its Motion. But
to come to the true Cause of their Desertion: After
my having discover'd the (long unknown) Occasion
that drove <i>Dogget</i> from the Stage before his settled
Inclination to leave it, it will be less incredible that
these Actors, upon the first Opportunity to relieve
themselves, should all in one Day have left us from
the same Cause of Uneasiness. For, in a little time
after, upon not finding their Expectations answer'd
in <i>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</i>, some of them, who seem'd
to answer for the rest, told me the greatest Grievance
they had in our Company was the shocking Temper
of <i>Wilks</i>, who, upon every, almost no Occasion, let
loose the unlimited Language of Passion upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
in such a manner as their Patience was not longer
able to support. This, indeed, was what we could
not justify! This was a Secret that might have
made a wholesome Paragraph in a critical News-Paper!
But as it was our good Fortune that it
came not to the Ears of our Enemies, the Town
was not entertain'd with their publick Remarks upon
it.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>After this new Theatre had enjoy'd that short Run
of Favour which is apt to follow Novelty, their
Audiences began to flag: But whatever good Opinion
we had of our own Merit, we had not so good
a one of the Multitude as to depend too much upon
the Delicacy of their Taste: We knew, too, that this
Company, being so much nearer to the City than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span> we
were, would intercept many an honest Customer that
might not know a good Market from a bad one; and
that the thinnest of their Audiences must be always
taking something from the Measure of our Profits.
All these Disadvantages, with many others, we were
forced to lay before Sir <i>Richard Steele</i>, and farther
to remonstrate to him, that as he now stood in <i>Collier</i>'s
Place, his Pension of 700<i>l.</i> was liable to the
same Conditions that <i>Collier</i> had receiv'd it upon;
which were, that it should be only payable during
our being the only Company permitted to act, but in
case another should be set up against us, that then
this Pension was to be liquidated into an equal Share
with us; and which we now hoped he would be contented
with. While we were offering to proceed, Sir
<i>Richard</i> stopt us short by assuring us, that as he
came among us by our own Invitation, he should
always think himself oblig'd to come into any Measures
for our Ease and Service: That to be a Burthen
to our Industry would be more disagreeable to him
than it could be to us; and as he had always taken
a Delight in his Endeavours for our Prosperity, he
should be still ready on our own Terms to continue
them. Every one who knew Sir <i>Richard Steele</i> in
his Prosperity (before the Effects of his Good-nature
had brought him to Distresses) knew that this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
his manner of dealing with his Friends in Business:
Another Instance of the same nature will immediately
fall in my way.</p>

<p>When we proposed to put this Agreement into
Writing, he desired us not to hurry ourselves; for
that he was advised, upon the late Desertion of our
Actors, to get our License (which only subsisted
during Pleasure) enlarg'd into a more ample and
durable Authority, and which he said he had Reason
to think would be more easily obtain'd, if we were
willing that a Patent for the same Purpose might be
granted to him only, for his Life and three Years
after, which he would then assign over to us. This
was a Prospect beyond our Hopes; and what we
had long wish'd for; for though I cannot say we
had ever Reason to grieve at the Personal Severities
or Behaviour of any one Lord-Chamberlain in my
Time, yet the several Officers under them who had
not the Hearts of Noblemen, often treated us (to
use <i>Shakespear</i>'s Expression) with all the <i>Insolence</i>
of <i>Office</i> that narrow Minds are apt to be elated
with; but a Patent, we knew, would free us from so
abject a State of Dependency. Accordingly, we
desired Sir <i>Richard</i> to lose no time; he was immediately
promised it: In the Interim, we sounded the
Inclination of the Actors remaining with us; who
had all Sense enough to know, that the Credit and
Reputation we stood in with the Town, could not
but be a better Security for their Sallaries, than the
Promise of any other Stage put into Bonds could
make good to them. In a few Days after, Sir
<i>Richard</i> told us, that his Majesty being apprised that
others had a joint Power with him in the License, it
was expected we should, under our Hands, signif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>y
that his Petition for a Patent was preferr'd by the
Consent of us all. Such an Acknowledgment was
immediately sign'd, and the Patent thereupon pass'd
the Great Seal; for which I remember the Lord
Chancellor <i>Cooper</i>, in Compliment to Sir <i>Richard</i>,
would receive no Fee.</p>

<p>We receiv'd the Patent <i>January 19, 1715</i>,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and
(Sir <i>Richard</i> being obliged the next Morning to set
out for <i>Burrowbridge</i> in <i>Yorkshire</i>, where he was
soon after elected Member of Parliament) we were
forced that very Night to draw up in a hurry ('till our
Counsel might more adviseably perfect it) his Assignment
to us of equal Shares in the Patent, with farther
Conditions of Partnership:<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> But here I ought
to take Shame to myself, and at the same time to
give this second Instance of the Equity and Honour
of Sir <i>Richard</i>: For this Assignment (which I had
myself the hasty Penning of) was so worded, that it
gave Sir <i>Richard</i> as equal a Title to our Property
as it had given us to his Authority in the Patent:
But Sir <i>Richard</i>, notwithstanding, when he return'd
to Town, took no Advantage of the Mistake, and
consented in our second Agreement to pay us Twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Hundred Pounds to be equally intitled to our Property,
which at his Death we were obliged to repay
(as we afterwards did) to his Executors; and which,
in case any of us had died before him, the Survivors
were equally obliged to have paid to the Executors
of such deceased Person upon the same Account.
But Sir <i>Richard</i>'s Moderation with us was rewarded
with the Reverse of <i>Collier</i>'s Stiffness: <i>Collier</i>, by
insisting on his Pension, lost Three Hundred Pounds
a Year; and Sir <i>Richard</i>, by his accepting a Share
in lieu of it, was, one Year with another, as much a
Gainer.</p>

<p>The Grant of this Patent having assured us of a
competent Term to be relied on, we were now emboldened
to lay out larger Sums in the Decorations
of our Plays:<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Upon the Revival of <i>Dryden</i>'s <i>All
for Love</i>, the Habits of that Tragedy amounted to
an Expence of near Six Hundred Pounds; a Sum
unheard of, for many Years before, on the like Occasions.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
But we thought such extraordinary Marks
of our Acknowledgment were due to the Favours
which the Publick were now again pouring in upon
us. About this time we were so much in fashion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
follow'd, that our Enemies (who they were it would
not be fair to guess, for we never knew them) made
their Push of a good round Lye upon us, to terrify
those Auditors from our Support whom they could
not mislead by their private Arts or publick Invectives.
A current Report that the Walls and Roof
of our House were liable to fall, had got such Ground
in the Town, that on a sudden we found our
Audiences unusually decreased by it: <i>Wilks</i> was
immediately for denouncing War and Vengeance on
the Author of this Falshood, and for offering a
Reward to whoever could discover him. But it was
thought more necessary first to disprove the Falshood,
and then to pay what Compliments might be thought
adviseable to the Author. Accordingly an Order
from the King was obtained, to have our Tenement
surveyed by Sir <i>Thomas Hewet</i>, then the proper
Officer; whose Report of its being in a safe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
sound Condition, and sign'd by him, was publish'd
in every News-Paper.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This had so immediate an
Effect, that our Spectators, whose Apprehensions
had lately kept them absent, now made up our
Losses by returning to us with a fresh Inclination
and in greater Numbers.</p>

<p>When it was first publickly known that the New
Theatre would be open'd against us; I cannot help
going a little back to remember the Concern that my
Brother-Menagers express'd at what might be the
Consequences of it. They imagined that now all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
those who wish'd Ill to us, and particularly a great
Party who had been disobliged by our shutting them
out from behind our Scenes, even to the Refusal of
their Money,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> would now exert themselves in any
partial or extravagant Measures that might either
hurt us or support our Competitors: These, too, were
some of those farther Reasons which had discouraged
them from running the hazard of continuing to Sir
<i>Richard Steele</i> the same Pension which had been
paid to <i>Collier</i>. Upon all which I observed to them,
that, for my own Part, I had not the same Apprehensions;
but that I foresaw as many good as bad
Consequences from two Houses: That tho' the
Novelty might possibly at first abate a little of our
Profits; yet, if we slacken'd not our Industry, that
Loss would be amply balanced by an equal Increase
of our Ease and Quiet: That those turbulent Spirits
which were always molesting us, would now have
other Employment: That the question'd Merit of
our Acting would now stand in a clearer Light when
others were faintly compared to us: That though
Faults might be found with the best Actors that ever
were, yet the egregious Defects that would appear in
others would now be the effectual means to make our
Superiority shine, if we had any Pretence to it: And
that what some People hoped might ruin us, would
in the end reduce them to give up the Dispute, and
reconcile them to those who could best entertain
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>In every Article of this Opinion they afterwards
found I had not been deceived; and the Truth of it
may be so well remember'd by many living Spectators,
that it would be too frivolous and needless a Boast
to give it any farther Observation.</p>

<p>But in what I have said I would not be understood
to be an Advocate for two Play-houses: For we
shall soon find that two Sets of Actors tolerated in
the same Place have constantly ended in the Corruption
of the Theatre; of which the auxiliary Entertainments
that have so barbarously supply'd the
Defects of weak Action have, for some Years past,
been a flagrant Instance; it may not, therefore, be
here improper to shew how our childish Pantomimes
first came to take so gross a Possession of the Stage.</p>

<p>I have upon several occasions already observ'd,
that when one Company is too hard for another, the
lower in Reputation has always been forced to exhibit
some new-fangled Foppery to draw the Multitude
after them: Of these Expedients, Singing and Dancing
had formerly been the most effectual;<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> but, at
the Time I am speaking of, our <i>English</i> Musick had
been so discountenanced since the Taste of <i>Italian</i>
Operas prevail'd, that it was to no purpose to pretend
to it.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Dancing therefore was now the only Weight
in the opposite Scale, and as the New Theatre sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
found their Account in it, it could not be safe
for us wholly to neglect it. To give even Dancing
therefore some Improvement, and to make it something
more than Motion without Meaning, the Fable
of <i>Mars</i> and <i>Venus</i><a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> was form'd into a connected
Presentation of Dances in Character, wherein the
Passions were so happily expressed, and the whole
Story so intelligibly told by a mute Narration of
Gesture only, that even thinking Spectators allow'd
it both a pleasing and a rational Entertainment;
though, at the same time, from our Distrust of its
Reception, we durst not venture to decorate it with
any extraordinary Expence of Scenes or Habits; but
upon the Success of this Attempt it was rightly concluded,
that if a visible Expence in both were added
to something of the same Nature, it could not fail of
drawing the Town proportionably after it. From
this original Hint then (but every way unequal to it)
sprung forth that Succession of monstrous Medlies
that have so long infested the Stage, and which
arose upon one another alternately, at both Houses
outvying in Expence, like contending Bribes on both
sides at an Election, to secure a Majority of the
Multitude. But so it is, Truth may complain and
Merit murmur with what Justice it may, the Few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
will never be a Match for the Many, unless Authority
should think fit to interpose and put down these
Poetical Drams, these Gin-shops of the Stage, that
intoxicate its Auditors and dishonour their Understanding
with a Levity for which I want a Name.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>If I am ask'd (after my condemning these Fooleries
myself) how I came to assent or continue my Share
of Expence to them? I have no better Excuse for
my Error than confessing it. I did it against my
Conscience! and had not Virtue enough to starve
by opposing a Multitude that would have been too
hard for me.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Now let me ask an odd Questio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>n:
Had <i>Harry the Fourth</i> of <i>France</i> a better Excuse
for changing his Religion?<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> I was still, in my Heart,
as much as he could be, on the side of Truth and
Sense, but with this difference, that I had their leave
to quit them when they could not support me: For
what Equivalent could I have found for my falling a
Martyr to them? How far the Heroe or the Comedian
was in the wrong, let the Clergy and the
Criticks decide. Necessity will be as good a Plea
for the one as the other. But let the Question go
which way it will, <i>Harry</i> IV. has always been allow'd
a great Man: And what I want of his Grandeur,
you see by the Inference, Nature has amply supply'd
to me in Vanity; a Pleasure which neither the Pertness
of Wit or the Gravity of Wisdom will ever persuade
me to part with. And why is there not as
much Honesty in owning as in concealing it? For
though to hide it may be Wisdom, to be without it
is impossible; and where is the Merit of keeping a
Secret which every Body is let into? To <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>say we
have no Vanity, then, is shewing a great deal of it;
as to say we <i>have</i> a great deal cannot be shewing so
much: And tho' there may be Art in a Man's accusing
himself, even then it will be more pardonable
than Self-commendation. Do not we find that even
good Actions have their Share of it? that it is as
inseparable from our Being as our Nakedness? And
though it may be equally decent to cover it, yet the
wisest Man can no more be without it, than the
weakest can believe he was born in his Cloaths. If
then what we say of ourselves be true, and not prejudicial
to others, to be called vain upon it is no more
a Reproach than to be called a brown or a fair Man.
Vanity is of all Complexions; 'tis the growth of
every Clime and Capacity; Authors of all Ages have
had a Tincture of it; and yet you read <i>Horace</i>,
<i>Montaign</i>, and Sir <i>William Temple</i>, with Pleasure.
Nor am I sure, if it were curable by Precept, that
Mankind would be mended by it! Could Vanity be
eradicated from our Nature, I am afraid that the
Reward of most human Virtues would not be found
in this World! And happy is he who has no greater
Sin to answer for in the next!</p>

<p>But what is all this to the Theatrical Follies I was
talking of? Perhaps not a great deal; but it is to
my Purpose; for though I am an Historian, I do not
write to the Wise and Learned only; I hope to have
Readers of no more Judgment than some of my
<i>quondam</i> Auditors; and I am afraid they will be as
hardly contented with dry Matters of Fact, as with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span> a
plain Play without Entertainments: This Rhapsody,
therefore, has been thrown in as a Dance between
the Acts, to make up for the Dullness of what would
have been by itself only proper. But I now come
to my Story again.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, then, this our Compliance with
the vulgar Taste, we generally made use of these
Pantomimes but as Crutches to our weakest Plays:
Nor were we so lost to all Sense of what was valuable
as to dishonour our best Authors in such bad Company:
We had still a due Respect to several select
Plays that were able to be their own Support; and in
which we found our constant Account, without painting
and patching them out, like Prostitutes, with
these Follies in fashion: If therefore we were not so
strictly chaste in the other part of our Conduct, let
the Error of it stand among the silly Consequences
of Two Stages. Could the Interest of both Companies
have been united in one only Theatre, I had
been one of the Few that would have us'd my utmost
Endeavour of never admitting to the Stage any
Spectacle that ought not to have been seen there;
the Errors of my own Plays, which I could not see,
excepted. And though probably the Majority of
Spectators would not have been so well pleas'd with
a Theatre so regulated; yet Sense and Reason cannot
lose their intrinsick Value because the Giddy and the
Ignorant are blind and deaf, or numerous; and I cannot
help saying, it is a Reproach to a sensible People
to let Folly so publickly govern their Pleasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>While I am making this grave Declaration of
what I <i>would</i> have done had One only Stage been
continued; to obtain an easier Belief of my Sincerity
I ought to put my Reader in mind of what I <i>did</i> do,
even after Two Companies were again establish'd.</p>

<p>About this Time <i>Jacobitism</i> had lately exerted
itself by the most unprovoked Rebellion that our
Histories have handed down to us since the <i>Norman</i>
Conquest:<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> I therefore thought that to set the
Authors and Principles of that desperate Folly in a
fair Light, by allowing the mistaken Consciences of
some their best Excuse, and by making the artful
Pretenders to Conscience as ridiculous as they were
ungratefully wicked, was a Subject fit for the honest
Satire of Comedy, and what might, if it succeeded,
do Honour to the Stage by shewing the valuable
Use of it.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> And considering what Numbers at that
time might come to it as prejudic'd Spectators, it
may be allow'd that the Undertaking was not less
hazardous than laudable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>
<p>To give Life, therefore, to this Design, I borrow'd
the <i>Tartuffe</i> of <i>Moliere</i>, and turn'd him into a
modern <i>Nonjuror</i>:<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Upon the Hypocrisy of the
<i>French</i> Character I ingrafted a stronger Wickedness,
that of an <i>English</i> Popish Priest lurking under
the Doctrine of our own Church to raise his Fortune
upon the Ruin of a worthy Gentleman, whom his
dissembled Sanctity had seduc'd into the treasonable
Cause of a <i>Roman Catholick</i> Out-law. How this
Design, in the Play, was executed, I refer to the
Readers of it; it cannot be mended by any critical
Remarks I can make in its favour: Let it speak for
itself. All the Reason I had to think it no bad Performance
was, that it was acted eighteen Days
running,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and that the Party that were hurt by it (as
I have been told) have not been the smallest Number
of my back Friends ever since. But happy was
it for this Play that the very Subject was its Protection;
a few Smiles of silent Contempt were the
utmost Disgrace that on the first Day of its Appearance
it was thought safe to throw upon it; as the
Satire was chiefly employ'd on the Enemies of the
Government, they were not so hardy as to own
themselves such by any higher Disapprobation or
Resentment. But as it was then probable I mi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>ght
write again, they knew it would not be long before
they might with more Security give a Loose to their
Spleen, and make up Accounts with me. And to do
them Justice, in every Play I afterwards produced
they paid me the Balance to a Tittle.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> But to none
was I more beholden than that celebrated Author
Mr. <i>Mist</i>, whose <i>Weekly Journal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> for about fifteen
Years following, scarce ever fail'd of passing some of
his Party Compliments upon me: The State and the
Stage were his frequent Parallels, and the Minister
and <i>Minheer Keiber</i> the Menager were as constantly
droll'd upon: Now, for my own Part, though I could
never persuade my Wit to have an open Account
with him (for as he had no Effects of his own, I did
not think myself oblig'd to answer his Bills;) notwithstanding,
I will be so charitable to his real
<i>Manes</i>, and to the Ashes of his Paper, as to mention
one particular Civility he paid to my Memory, after
he thought he had ingeniously kill'd me. Soon afte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>r
the <i>Nonjuror</i> had receiv'd the Favour of the Town,
I read in one of his Journals the following short
Paragraph, <i>viz.</i> <i>Yesterday died Mr.</i> Colley Cibber,
<i>late Comedian of the Theatre-Royal, notorious for
writing the</i> Nonjuror. The Compliment in the
latter part I confess I did not dislike, because it
came from so impartial a Judge; and it really so
happen'd that the former part of it was very near
being true; for I had that very Day just crawled
out, after having been some Weeks laid up by a
Fever: However, I saw no use in being thought to
be thoroughly dead before my Time, and therefore
had a mind to see whether the Town cared to have
me alive again: So the Play of the <i>Orphan</i> being
to be acted that Day, I quietly stole myself into the
Part of the <i>Chaplain</i>, which I had not been seen
in for many Years before. The Surprize of the
Audience at my unexpected Appearance on the very
Day I had been dead in the News, and the Paleness
of my Looks, seem'd to make it a Doubt whether
I was not the Ghost of my real Self departed: But
when I spoke, their Wonder eas'd itself by an
Applause; which convinc'd me they were then satisfied
that my Friend <i>Mist</i> had told a <i>Fib</i> of me.
Now, if simply to have shown myself in broad Life,
and about my Business, after he had <i>notoriously</i>
reported me dead, can be called a Reply, it was the
only one which his Paper while alive ever drew from
me. How far I may be vain, then, in supposing that
this Play brought me into the Disfavour of so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Wits<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and valiant Auditors as afterwards appear'd
against me, let those who may think it worth their
Notice judge. In the mean time, 'till I can find a better
Excuse for their sometimes particular Treatment of
me, I cannot easily give up my Suspicion: And if I
add a more remarkable Fact, that afterwards confirm'd
me in it, perhaps it may incline others to join
in my Opinion.</p>

<p>On the first Day of the <i>Provok'd Husband</i>, ten
Years after the <i>Nonjuror</i> had appear'd,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> a powerful
Party, not having the Fear of publick Offence or
private Injury before their Eyes, appear'd most impetuously
concern'd for the Demolition of it; in
which they so far succeeded, that for some Time I
gave it up for lost; and to follow their Blows, in the
publick Papers of the next Day it was attack'd and
triumph'd over as a dead and damn'd Piece; a
swinging Criticism was made upon it in general
invective Terms, for they disdain'd to trouble the
World with Particulars; their Sentence, it seems,
was Proof enough of its deserving the Fate it had
met with. But this damn'd Play was, notwithstanding,
acted twenty-eight Nights together, and left off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
at a Receipt of upwards of a hundred and forty
Pounds; which happen'd to be more than in fifty
Years before could be then said of any one Play
whatsoever.</p>

<p>Now, if such notable Behaviour could break out
upon so successful a Play (which too, upon the Share
Sir <i>John Vanbrugh</i> had in it, I will venture to call
a good one) what shall we impute it to? Why may
not I plainly say, it was not the Play, but Me, who
had a Hand in it, they did not like? And for what
Reason? if they were not asham'd of it, why did not
they publish it? No! the Reason had publish'd
itself, I was the Author of the <i>Nonjuror</i>! But,
perhaps, of all Authors, I ought not to make this
sort of Complaint, because I have Reason to think
that that particular Offence has made me more
honourable Friends than Enemies; the latter of which
I am not unwilling should know (however unequal the
Merit may be to the Reward) that Part of the Bread I
now eat was given me for having writ the <i>Nonjuror</i>.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>And yet I cannot but lament, with many quiet
Spectators, the helpless Misfortune that has so many
Years attended the Stage! That no Law has had
Force enough to give it absolute Protection! for
'till we can civilize its Auditors, the Authors that
write for it will seldom have a greater Call to it than
Necessity; and how unlikely is the Imagination of
the Needy to inform or delight the Many in Afflu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>ence?
or how often does Necessity make many
unhappy Gentlemen turn Authors in spite of Nature?</p>

<p>What a Blessing, therefore, is it! what an enjoy'd
Deliverance! after a Wretch has been driven by
Fortune to stand so many wanton Buffets of unmanly
Fierceness, to find himself at last quietly lifted above
the Reach of them!</p>

<p>But let not this Reflection fall upon my Auditors
without Distinction; for though Candour and Benevolence
are silent Virtues, they are as visible as the
most vociferous Ill-nature; and I confess the Publick
has given me more frequently Reason to be
thankful than to complain.</p>

<p>Having brought the Government of the Stage
through such various Changes and Revolutions,
to this settled State in which it continued to
almost the Time of my leaving it;<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> it cannot be suppos'd
that a Period of so much Quiet and so long a
Train of Success (though happy for those who enjoy'd
it) can afford such Matter of Surprize or Amusement,
as might arise from Times of more Distress and
Disorder. A quiet Time in History, like a Calm in
a Voyage, leaves us but in an indolent Station: To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
talk of our Affairs when they were no longer ruffled
by Misfortunes, would be a Picture without Shade,
a flat Performance at best. As I might, therefore,
throw all that tedious Time of our Tranquillity into
one Chasm in my History, and cut my Way short
at once to my last Exit from the Stage, I shall at
least fill it up with such Matter only as I have a
mind should be known,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> how few soever may have
Patience to read it: Yet, as I despair not of some
Readers who may be most awake when they think
others have most occasion to sleep; who may be
more pleas'd to find me languid than lively, or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span> the
wrong than in the right; why should I scruple (when
it is so easy a Matter too) to gratify their particular
Taste by venturing upon any Error that I like, or
the Weakness of my Judgment misleads me to commit?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
I think, too, I have a very good Chance for
my Success in this passive Ambition, by shewing
myself in a Light I have not been seen in.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>
<p>By your Leave then, Gentlemen! let the Scene
open, and at once discover your Comedian at the
Bar! There you will find him a Defendant, and
pleading his own Theatrical Cause in a Court of
<i>Chancery</i>: But, as I chuse to have a Chance of pleasing
others as well as of indulging you, Gentlemen; I
must first beg leave to open my Case to them; after
which my whole Speech upon that Occasion shall be
at your Mercy.</p>

<p>In all the Transactions of Life, there cannot be a
more painful Circumstance, than a Dispute at Law
with a Man with whom we have long liv'd in an
agreeable Amity: But when Sir <i>Richard Steele</i>, to
get himself out of Difficulties, was oblig'd to throw
his Affairs into the Hands of Lawyers and Trustees,
that Consideration, then, could be of no weight: The
Friend, or the Gentleman, had no more to do in the
Matter! Thus, while Sir <i>Richard</i> no longer acted
from himself, it may be no Wonder if a Flaw was
found in our Conduct for the Law to make Work
with. It must be observed, then, that about two or
three Years before this Suit was commenc'd, upon
Sir <i>Richard</i>'s totally absenting himself from all Care
and Menagement of the Stage (which by our Art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>icles
of Partnership he was equally and jointly oblig'd
with us to attend) we were reduc'd to let him know
that we could not go on at that Rate; but that if he
expected to make the Business a <i>sine-Cure</i>, we had
as much Reason to expect a Consideration for our
extraordinary Care of it; and that during his Absence
we therefore intended to charge our selves at a
Sallary of 1<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> every acting Day (unless he
could shew us Cause to the contrary) for our Menagement:
To which, in his compos'd manner, he only
answer'd; That to be sure we knew what was fitter
to be done than he did; that he had always taken a
Delight in making us easy, and had no Reason to
doubt of our doing him Justice. Now whether, under
this easy Stile of Approbation, he conceal'd any Dislike
of our Resolution, I cannot say. But, if I may
speak my private Opinion, I really believe, from his
natural Negligence of his Affairs, he was glad, at any
rate, to be excus'd an Attendance which he was now
grown weary of. But, whether I am deceiv'd or
right in my Opinion, the Fact was truly this, that he
never once, directly nor indirectly, complain'd or objected
to our being paid the above-mention'd daily
Sum in near three Years together; and yet still continued
to absent himself from us and our Affairs.
But notwithstanding he had seen and done all this
with his Eyes open; his Lawyer thought here was
still a fair Field for a Battle in Chancery, in which,
though his Client might be beaten, he was sure his
Bill must be paid for it: Accordingly, to work wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>th
us he went. But, not to be so long as the Lawyers
were in bringing this Cause to an Issue, I shall at
once let you know, that it came to a Hearing before
the late Sir <i>Joseph Jekyll</i>, then Master of the Rolls,
in the Year 1726.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Now, as the chief Point in dispute
was, of what Kind or Importance the Business
of a Menager was, or in what it principally consisted;
it could not be suppos'd that the most learned Council
could be so well appriz'd of the Nature of it, as one
who had himself gone through the Care and Fatigue
of it. I was therefore encourag'd by our Council to
speak to that particular Head myself; which I confess
I was glad he suffer'd me to undertake; but when I
tell you that two of the learned Council against us
came afterwards to be successively Lord-Chancellors,
it sets my Presumption in a Light that I still tremble
to shew it in: But however, not to assume more
Merit from its Success than was really its Due, I
ought fairly to let you know, that I was not so hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>y
as to deliver my Pleading without Notes, in my
Hand, of the Heads I intended to enlarge upon; for
though I thought I could conquer my Fear, I could
not be so sure of my Memory: But when it came to
the critical Moment, the Dread and Apprehension of
what I had undertaken so disconcerted my Courage,
that though I had been us'd to talk to above Fifty
Thousand different People every Winter, for upwards
of Thirty Years together; an involuntary and unaffected
Proof of my Confusion fell from my Eyes;
and, as I found myself quite out of my Element, I
seem'd rather gasping for Life than in a condition to
cope with the eminent Orators against me. But,
however, I soon found, from the favourable Attention
of my Hearers, that my Diffidence had done me no
Disservice: And as the Truth I was to speak to
needed no Ornament of Words, I delivered it in the
plain manner following, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>In this Cause, Sir, I humbly conceive there are
but two Points that admit of any material Dispute.
The first is, Whether Sir <i>Richard Steele</i> is as much
obliged to do the Duty and Business of a Menager
as either <i>Wilks</i>, <i>Booth</i>, or <i>Cibber</i>: And the second
is, Whether by Sir <i>Richard</i>'s totally withdrawing
himself from the Business of a Menager, the Defendants
are justifiable in charging to each of themselves
the 1<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>per Diem</i> for their particular Pains
and Care in carrying on the whole Affairs of the
Stage without any Assistance from Sir <i>Richard Steele</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>
<p>As to the First, if I don't mistake the Words of
the Assignment, there is a Clause in it that says, All
Matters relating to the Government or Menagement
of the Theatre shall be concluded by a Majority of
Voices. Now I presume, Sir, there is no room left
to alledge that Sir <i>Richard</i> was ever refused his
Voice, though in above three Years he never desir'd
to give it: And I believe there will be as little room
to say, that he could have a Voice if he were not a
Menager. But, Sir, his being a Menager is so self-evident,
that it is amazing how he could conceive
that he was to take the Profits and Advantages of a
Menager without doing the Duty of it. And I will
be bold to say, Sir, that his Assignment of the Patent
to <i>Wilks</i>, <i>Booth</i>, and <i>Cibber</i>, in no one Part of it,
by the severest Construction in the World, can be
wrested to throw the heavy Burthen of the Menagement
only upon their Shoulders. Nor does it appear,
Sir, that either in his Bill, or in his Answer to our
Cross-Bill, he has offer'd any Hint, or Glimpse of a
Reason, for his withdrawing from the Menagement
at all; or so much as pretend, from the time complained
of, that he ever took the least Part of his
Share of it. Now, Sir, however unaccountable this
Conduct of Sir <i>Richard</i> may seem, we will still allow
that he had some Cause for it; but whether or no
that Cause was a reasonable one your Honour will
the better judge, if I may be indulged in the Liberty
of explaining it.</p>

<p>Sir, the Case, in plain Truth and Reality, stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>s
thus: Sir <i>Richard</i>, though no Man alive can write
better of Oeconomy than himself, yet, perhaps, he is
above the Drudgery of practising it: Sir <i>Richard</i>,
then, was often in want of Money; and while we
were in Friendship with him, we often assisted his
Occasions: But those Compliances had so unfortunate
an Effect, that they only heightened his Importunity
to borrow more, and the more we lent, the less
he minded us, or shew'd any Concern for our Welfare.
Upon this, Sir, we stopt our Hands at once,
and peremptorily refus'd to advance another Shilling
'till by the Balance of our Accounts it became due to
him. And this Treatment (though, we hope, not in
the least unjustifiable) we have Reason to believe
so ruffled his Temper, that he at once was as short
with us as we had been with him; for, from that Day,
he never more came near us: Nay, Sir, he not only
continued to neglect what he <i>should</i> have done, but
actually did what he ought <i>not</i> to have done: He
made an Assignment of his Share without our Consent,
in a manifest Breach of our Agreement: For,
Sir, we did not lay that Restriction upon ourselves
for no Reason: We knew, before-hand, what Trouble
and Inconvenience it would be to unravel and expose
our Accounts to Strangers, who, if they were to do
us no hurt by divulging our Secrets, we were sure
could do us no good by keeping them. If Sir <i>Richard</i>
had had our common Interest at heart, he would
have been as warm in it as we were, and as tender
of hurting it: But supposing his assigning his Share
to others may have done us no great Injury, it is, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
least, a shrewd Proof that he did not care whether it
did us any or no. And if the Clause was not strong
enough to restrain him from it in Law, there was
enough in it to have restrain'd him in Honour from
breaking it. But take it in its best Light, it shews
him as remiss a Menager in our Affairs as he naturally
was in his own. Suppose, Sir, we had all been
as careless as himself, which I can't find he has any
more Right to be than we have, must not our whole
Affair have fallen to Ruin? And may we not, by a
parity of Reason, suppose, that by his Neglect a
fourth Part of it <i>does</i> fall to Ruin? But, Sir, there is
a particular Reason to believe, that, from our want
of Sir <i>Richard</i>, more than a fourth Part <i>does</i> suffer
by it: His Rank and Figure in the World, while he
gave us the Assistance of them, were of extraordinary
Service to us: He had an easier Access, and a
more regarded Audience at Court, than our low
Station of Life could pretend to, when our Interest
wanted (as it often did) a particular Solicitation
there. But since we have been deprived of him, the
very End, the very Consideration of his Share in
our Profits is not perform'd on his Part. And will
Sir <i>Richard</i>, then, make us no Compensation for so
valuable a Loss in our Interests, and so palpable an
Addition to our Labour? I am afraid, Sir, if we were
all to be as indolent in the Menaging-Part as Sir
<i>Richard</i> presumes he has a Right to be; our Patent
would soon run us as many Hundreds in Debt, as he
had (and still seems willing to have) his Share of, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>for
doing of nothing.</p>

<p>Sir, our next Point in question is whether <i>Wilks</i>,
<i>Booth</i>, and <i>Cibber</i> are justifiable in charging the
1<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>per diem</i> for their extraordinary Menagement
in the Absence of Sir <i>Richard Steele</i>. I doubt,
Sir, it will be hard to come to the Solution of this
Point, unless we may be a little indulg'd in setting
forth what is the daily and necessary Business and
Duty of a Menager. But, Sir, we will endeavour to
be as short as the Circumstances will admit of.</p>

<p>Sir, by our Books it is apparent that the Menagers
have under their Care no less than One Hundred
and Forty Persons in constant daily Pay: And
among such Numbers, it will be no wonder if a
great many of them are unskilful, idle, and sometimes
untractable; all which Tempers are to be led,
or driven, watch'd, and restrain'd by the continual
Skill, Care, and Patience of the Menagers. Every
Menager is oblig'd, in his turn, to attend two or three
Hours every Morning at the Rehearsal of Plays and
other Entertainments for the Stage, or else every
Rehearsal would be but a rude Meeting of Mirth
and Jollity. The same Attendance is as necessary
at every Play during the time of its publick Action,
in which one or more of us have constantly been
punctual, whether we have had any part in the Play
then acted or not. A Menager ought to be at the
Reading of every new Play when it is first offer'd to
the Stage, though there are seldom one of those
Plays in twenty which, upon hearing, proves to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
fit for it; and upon such Occasions the Attendance
must be allow'd to be as painfully tedious as the
getting rid of the Authors of such Plays must be
disagreeable and difficult. Besides this, Sir, a
Menager is to order all new Cloaths, to assist in the
Fancy and Propriety of them, to limit the Expence,
and to withstand the unreasonable Importunities of
some that are apt to think themselves injur'd if they
are not finer than their Fellows. A Menager is to
direct and oversee the Painters, Machinists, Musicians,
Singers, and Dancers; to have an Eye upon the
Door-keepers, Under-Servants, and Officers that,
without such Care, are too often apt to defraud us,
or neglect their Duty.</p>

<p>And all this, Sir, and more, much more, which we
hope will be needless to trouble you with, have we
done every Day, without the least Assistance from
Sir <i>Richard</i>, even at times when the Concern and
Labour of our Parts upon the Stage have made it
very difficult and irksome to go through with it.</p>

<p>In this Place, Sir, it may be worth observing that
Sir <i>Richard</i>, in his Answer to our Cross-Bill, seems
to value himself upon <i>Cibber</i>'s confessing, in the Dedication
of a Play which he made to Sir <i>Richard</i>,
that he (Sir <i>Richard</i>) had done the Stage very considerable
Service by leading the Town to our Plays,
and filling our Houses by the Force and Influence
of his <i>Tatlers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> But Sir <i>Richard</i> forgets that those
<i>Tatlers</i> were written in the late Queen's Reign, long
before he was admitted to a Share in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>Play-house:
And in truth, Sir, it was our real Sense of those
Obligations, and Sir <i>Richard</i>'s assuring us they
should be continued, that first and chiefly inclin'd us
to invite him to share the Profits of our Labours,
upon such farther Conditions as in his Assignment
of the Patent to us are specified. And, Sir, as <i>Cibber</i>'s
publick Acknowledgment of those Favours is at the
same time an equal Proof of Sir <i>Richard</i>'s <i>Power</i> to
continue them; so, Sir, we hope it carries an equal
Probability that, without his Promise to <i>use</i> that
Power, he would never have been thought on, much
less have been invited by us into a Joint-Menagement
of the Stage, and into a Share of the Profits:
And, indeed, what Pretence could he have form'd for
asking a Patent from the Crown, had he been possess'd
of no eminent Qualities but in common with
other Men? But, Sir, all these Advantages, all these
Hopes, nay, Certainties of greater Profits from those
great Qualities, have we been utterly depriv'd of by
the wilful and unexpected Neglect of Sir <i>Richard</i>.
But we find, Sir, it is a common thing in the Practice
of Mankind to justify one Error by committing
another: For Sir <i>Richard</i> has not only refused us
the extraordinary Assistance which he is able and
bound to give us; but, on the contrary, to our great
Expence and Loss of Time, now calls us to account,
in this honourable Court, for the Wrong we have
done him, in not doing his Business of a Menager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
for nothing. But, Sir, Sir <i>Richard</i> has not met with
such Treatment from us: He has not writ Plays for
us for <i>Nothing</i>, we paid him very well, and in an
extraordinary manner, for his late Comedy of the
<i>Conscious Lovers</i>: And though, in writing that Play,
he had more Assistance from one of the Menagers<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
than becomes me to enlarge upon, of which Evidence
has been given upon Oath by several of our Actors;
yet, Sir, he was allow'd the full and particular Profits
of that Play as an Author, which amounted to Three
Hundred Pounds, besides about Three Hundred
more which he received as a Joint-Sharer of the
general Profits that arose from it. Now, Sir, though
the Menagers are not all of them able to write Plays,
yet they have all of them been able to do (I won't
say as good, but at least) as profitable a thing. They
have invented and adorn'd a Spectacle that for Forty
Days together has brought more Money to the
House than the best Play that ever was writ. The
Spectacle I mean, Sir, is that of the Coronation-Ceremony
of <i>Anna Bullen</i>:<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> And though we allow a
good Play to be the more laudable Performance, yet,
Sir, in the profitable Part of it there is no Comparison.
If, therefore, our Spectacle brought in as
much, or more Money than Sir <i>Richard</i>'s Comedy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>what is there on his Side but Usage that intitles him
to be paid for one, more than we are for t'other?
But then, Sir, if he is so profitably distinguish'd for
his Play, if we yield him up the Preference, and pay
him for his extraordinary Composition, and take
nothing for our own, though it turn'd out more to
our common Profit; sure, Sir, while we do such extraordinary
Duty as Menagers, and while he neglects
his Share of that Duty, he cannot grudge us the
moderate Demand we make for our separate Labour?</p>

<p>To conclude, Sir, if by our constant Attendance,
our Care, our Anxiety (not to mention the disagreeable
Contests we sometimes meet with, both within
and without Doors, in the Menagement of our
Theatre) we have not only saved the whole from
Ruin, which, if we had all follow'd Sir <i>Richard</i>'s
Example, could not have been avoided; I say, Sir,
if we have still made it so valuable an Income to
him, without his giving us the least Assistance for
several Years past; we hope, Sir, that the poor
Labourers that have done all this for Sir <i>Richard</i>
will not be thought unworthy of their Hire.</p>

<p>How far our Affairs, being set in this particular
Light, might assist our Cause, may be of no great
Importance to guess; but the Issue of it was this:
That Sir <i>Richard</i> not having made any Objection
to what we had charged for Menagement for three
Years together; and as our Proceedings had been all
transacted in open Day, without any clandestine Intention
of Fraud; we were allow'd the Sums in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
dispute above-mention'd; and Sir <i>Richard</i> not being
advised to appeal to the Lord-Chancellor, both
Parties paid their own Costs, and thought it their
mutual Interest to let this be the last of their Law-suits.</p>

<p>And now, gentle Reader, I ask Pardon for so long
an Imposition on your Patience: For tho' I may
have no ill Opinion of this Matter myself; yet to you
I can very easily conceive it may have been tedious.
You are, therefore, at your own Liberty of charging
the whole Impertinence of it, either to the Weakness
of my Judgment, or the Strength of my Vanity; and I
will so far join in your Censure, that I farther confess
I have been so impatient to give it you, that you have
had it out of its Turn: For, some Years before this
Suit was commenced, there were other Facts that
ought to have had a Precedence in my History: But
that, I dare say, is an Oversight you will easily excuse,
provided you afterwards find them worth reading.
However, as to that Point I must take my Chance,
and shall therefore proceed to speak of the Theatre
which was order'd by his late Majesty to be erected
in the Great old Hall at <i>Hampton-Court</i>; where
Plays were intended to have been acted twice a Week
during the Summer-Season. But before the Theatre
could be finish'd, above half the Month of <i>September</i>
being elapsed, there were but seven Plays acted
before the Court returned to <i>London</i>.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> This throwing
open a Theatre in a Royal Palace seem'd to be
reviving the Old <i>English</i> hospitable Grandeur, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the lowest Rank of neighbouring Subjects might
make themselves merry at Court without being
laugh'd at themselves. In former Reigns, Theatrical
Entertainments at the Royal Palaces had been
perform'd at vast Expence, as appears by the Description
of the Decorations in several of <i>Ben. Johnson</i>'s
Masques in King <i>James</i> and <i>Charles the First</i>'s
Time;<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> many curious and original Draughts of which,
by Sir <i>Inigo Jones</i>, I have seen in the <i>Mus√¶um</i> of
our greatest Master and Patron of Arts and Architecture,
whom it would be a needless Liberty to
name.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> But when our Civil Wars ended in the
Decadence of Monarchy, it was then an Honour to
the Stage to have fallen with it: Yet, after the Restoration
of <i>Charles</i> II. some faint Attempts were
made to revive these Theatrical Spectacles at Court;
but I have met with no Account of above one Masque
acted there by the Nobility; which was that of <i>Calisto</i>,
written by <i>Crown</i>, the Author of Sir <i>Courtly Nice</i>.
For what Reason <i>Crown</i> was chosen to that Honour
rather than <i>Dryden</i>, who was then Poet-Laureat and
out of all Comparison his Superior in Poetry, may
seem surprizing: But if we consider the Offence
which the then Duke of <i>Buckingham</i> took at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Character of <i>Zimri</i> in <i>Dryden</i>'s <i>Absalom</i>, &amp;c. (which
might probably be a Return to his Grace's <i>Drawcansir</i>
in the <i>Rehearsal</i>) we may suppose the Prejudice
and Recommendation of so illustrious a Pretender to
Poetry might prevail at Court to give Crown this
Preference.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> In the same Reign the King had his
Comedians at <i>Windsor</i>, but upon a particular Establishment;
for tho' they acted in St. <i>George</i>'s Hall,
within the Royal Palace, yet (as I have been inform'd
by an Eye-witness) they were permitted to take
Money at the Door of every Spectator; whether
this was an Indulgence, in Conscience I cannot say;
but it was a common Report among the principal
Actors, when I first came into the <i>Theatre-Royal</i>, in
1690, that there was then due to the Company from
that Court about One Thousand Five Hundred
Pounds for Plays commanded, <i>&amp;c.</i> and yet it was
the general Complaint, in that Prince's Reign, that
he paid too much Ready-money for his Pleasures:
But these Assertions I only give as I received them,
without being answerable for their Reality. This
Theatrical Anecdote, however, puts me in mind of
one of a more private nature, which I had from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>old
solemn <i>Boman</i>, the late Actor of venerable Memory.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
<i>Boman</i>, then a Youth, and fam'd for his
Voice, was appointed to sing some Part in a Concert
of Musick at the private Lodgings of Mrs. <i>Gwin</i>; at
which were only present the King, the Duke of
<i>York</i>, and one or two more who were usually admitted
upon those detach'd Parties of Pleasure.
When the Performance was ended, the King express'd
himself highly pleased, and gave it extraordinary
Commendations: Then, Sir, said the Lady,
to shew you don't speak like a Courtier, I hope
you will make the Performers a handsome Present:
The King said he had no Money about him, and
ask'd the Duke if he had any? To which the Duke
reply'd, I believe, Sir, not above a Guinea or two.
Upon which the laughing Lady, turning to the
People about her, and making bold with the King's
common Expression, cry'd, <i>Od's Fish! what Company
am I got into!</i></p>

<p>Whether the reverend Historian of his <i>Own Time</i>,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
among the many other Reasons of the same Kind he
might have for sti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>ling this Fair One the <i>indiscreetest
and wildest Creature that ever was in a Court</i>, might
know this to be one of them, I can't say: But if we
consider her in all the Disadvantages of her Rank
and Education, she does not appear to have had any
criminal Errors more remarkable than her Sex's
Frailty to answer for: And if the same Author, in
his latter End of that Prince's Life, seems to reproach
his Memory with too kind a Concern for her
Support, we may allow that it becomes a Bishop
to have had no Eyes or Taste for the frivolous
Charms or playful <i>Badinage</i> of a King's Mistress:
Yet, if the common Fame of her may be believ'd,
which in my Memory was not doubted, she had less
to be laid to her Charge than any other of those
Ladies who were in the same State of Preferment:
She never meddled in Matters of serious Moment,
or was the Tool of working Politicians: Never
broke into those amorous Infidelities which others in
that grave Author are accus'd of; but was as visibly
distinguish'd by her particular Personal Inclination
to the King, as her Rivals were by their Titles and
Grandeur. Give me leave to carry (perhaps the
Partiality of) my Observation a little farther. The
same Author, in the same Page, 263,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> tells us, That
"Another of the King's Mistresses, the Daughter of
a Clergyman, Mrs. <i>Roberts</i>, in whom her first
Education had so deep a Root, that though she fell
into many scandalous Disorders, with very dismal
Adventures in them all, yet a Principle of Religion
was so deep laid in her, that tho' it did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
restrain her, yet it kept alive in her such a constant
Horror of Sin, that she was never easy in an ill
course, and died with a great Sense of her former
ill Life."</p>

<p>To all this let us give an implicit Credit: Here is
the Account of a frail Sinner made up with a
Reverend Witness! Yet I cannot but lament that
this Mitred Historian, who seems to know more Personal
Secrets than any that ever writ before him,
should not have been as inquisitive after the last
Hours of our other Fair Offender, whose Repentance
I have been unquestionably inform'd, appear'd
in all the contrite Symptoms of a Christian Sincerity.
If therefore you find I am so much concern'd
to make this favourable mention of the one, because
she was a Sister of the <i>Theatre</i>, why may not&mdash;But
I dare not be so presumptuous, so uncharitably
bold, as to suppose the other was spoken better of
merely because she was the Daughter of a <i>Clergyman</i>.
Well, and what then? What's all this idle Prate, you
may say, to the matter in hand? Why, I say your
Question is a little too critical; and if you won't give
an Author leave, now and then, to embellish his
Work by a natural Reflexion, you are an ungentle
Reader. But I have done with my Digression, and
return to our Theatre at <i>Hampton-Court</i>, where I am
not sure the Reader, be he ever so wise, will meet
with any thing more worth his notice: However, if
he happens to read, as I write, for want of something
better to do, he will go on; and perhaps wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
when I tell him that:</p>

<p>A Play presented at Court, or acted on a publick
Stage, seem to their different Auditors a different
Entertainment. Now hear my Reason for it.
In the common Theatre the Guests are at home,
where the politer Forms of Good-breeding are not
so nicely regarded: Every one there falls to, and
likes or finds fault according to his natural Taste or
Appetite. At Court, where the Prince gives the
Treat, and honours the Table with his own Presence,
the Audience is under the Restraint of a Circle, where
Laughter or Applause rais'd higher than a Whisper
would be star'd at. At a publick Play they are both
let loose, even 'till the Actor is sometimes pleas'd
with his not being able to be heard for the Clamour
of them. But this Coldness or Decency of Attention
at Court I observ'd had but a melancholy Effect
upon the impatient Vanity of some of our Actors,
who seem'd inconsolable when their flashy Endeavours
to please had pass'd unheeded: Their not considering
where they were quite disconcerted them;
nor could they recover their Spirits 'till from the
lowest Rank of the Audience some gaping <i>John</i> or
<i>Joan</i>, in the fullness of their Hearts, roar'd out their
Approbation: And, indeed, such a natural Instance
of honest Simplicity a Prince himself, whose Indulgence
knows where to make Allowances, might
reasonably smile at, and perhaps not think it the
worst part of his Entertainment. Yet it must be
own'd, that an Audience may be as well too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
reserv'd, as too profuse of their Applause: For
though it is possible a <i>Betterton</i> would not have
been discourag'd from throwing out an Excellence,
or elated into an Error, by his Auditors being too
little or too much pleas'd, yet, as Actors of his Judgment
are Rarities, those of less Judgment may sink
into a Flatness in their Performance for want of that
Applause, which from the generality of Judges they
might perhaps have some Pretence to: And the
Auditor, when not seeming to feel what ought to affect
him, may rob himself of something more that he might
have had by giving the Actor his Due, who measures
out his Power to please according to the Value he
sets upon his Hearer's Taste or Capacity. But, however,
as we were not here itinerant Adventurers,
and had properly but one Royal Auditor to please;
after that Honour was attain'd to, the rest of our Ambition
had little to look after: And that the King was
often pleas'd, we were not only assur'd by those who
had the Honour to be near him; but could see it, from
the frequent Satisfaction in his Looks at particular
Scenes and Passages: One Instance of which I am
tempted to relate, because it was at a Speech that
might more naturally affect a Sovereign Prince than
any private Spectator. In <i>Shakespear</i>'s <i>Harry the
Eighth</i>, that King commands the Cardinal to write
circular Letters of Indemnity into every County
where the Payment of certain heavy Taxes had
been disputed: Upon which the Cardinal whispers
the following Directions to his Secretary <i>Cromwell</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>&mdash;&mdash;A Word with you:</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Let there be Letters writ to every Shire</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Of the King's Grace and Pardon: The griev'd Commons</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Hardly conceive of me. Let it be nois'd</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>That through our Intercession this Revokement</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>And Pardon comes.&mdash;I shall anon advise you</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Farther in the Proceeding&mdash;&mdash;</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>The Solicitude of this Spiritual Minister, in filching
from his Master the Grace and Merit of a good
Action, and dressing up himself in it, while himself
had been Author of the Evil complain'd of, was so
easy a Stroke of his Temporal Conscience, that it
seem'd to raise the King into something more than a
Smile whenever that Play came before him: And I
had a more distinct Occasion to observe this Effect;
because my proper Stand on the Stage when I spoke
the Lines required me to be near the Box where the
King usually sate:<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> In a Word, this Play is so true
a Dramatick Chronicle of an old <i>English</i> Court, and
where the Character of <i>Harry the Eighth</i> is so
exactly drawn, even to a humourous Likeness, that
it may be no wonder why his Majesty's particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Taste for it should have commanded it three several
times in one Winter.</p>

<p>This, too, calls to my Memory an extravagant
Pleasantry of Sir <i>Richard Steele</i>, who being ask'd by
a grave Nobleman, after the same Play had been
presented at <i>Hampton-Court</i>, how the King lik'd it,
reply'd, <i>So terribly well, my Lord, that I was afraid
I should have lost all my Actors</i>! <i>For I was not sure
the King would not keep them to fill the Posts at
Court that he saw them so fit for in the Play.</i></p>

<p>It may be imagin'd that giving Plays to the People
at such a distance from <i>London</i> could not but be
attended with an extraordinary Expence; and it was
some Difficulty, when they were first talk'd of, to
bring them under a moderate Sum; I shall therefore,
in as few Words as possible, give a Particular
of what Establishment they were then brought to,
that in case the same Entertainments should at any
time hereafter be call'd to the same Place, future
Courts may judge how far the Precedent may stand
good, or need an Alteration.</p>

<p>Though the stated Fee for a Play acted at <i>Whitehall</i>
had been formerly but Twenty Pounds;<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> yet, as
that hinder'd not the Compan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>y's acting on the same
Day at the Publick Theatre, that Sum was almost
all clear Profits to them: But this Circumstance not
being practicable when they were commanded to
<i>Hampton-Court</i>, a new and extraordinary Charge
was unavoidable: The Menagers, therefore, not to
inflame it, desired no Consideration for their own
Labour, farther than the Honour of being employ'd
in his Majesty's Commands; and, if the other Actors
might be allow'd each their Day's Pay and travelling
Charges, they should hold themselves ready to act
any Play there at a Day's Warning: And that the
Trouble might be less by being divided, the Lord-Chamberlain
was pleas'd to let us know that the
Houshold-Musick, the Wax Lights, and a <i>Chaise-Marine</i>
to carry our moving Wardrobe to every
different Play, should be under the Charge of the
proper Officers. Notwithstanding these Assistances,
the Expence of every Play amounted to Fifty Pounds:
Which Account, when all was over, was not only
allow'd us, but his Majesty was graciously pleas'd to
give the Menagers Two Hundred Pounds more for
their particular Performance and Trouble in only
seven times acting.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Which last Sum, though it
might not be too much for a Sovereign Prince to
give, it was certainly more than our utmost Merit
ought to have hop'd for: And I confess, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
receiv'd the Order for the Money from his Grace
the Duke of <i>Newcastle</i>, then Lord-Chamberlain, I
was so surpris'd, that I imagin'd his Grace's Favour,
or Recommendation of our Readiness or Diligence,
must have contributed to so high a Consideration of
it, and was offering my Acknowledgments as I
thought them due; but was soon stopt short by his
Grace's Declaration, That we had no Obligations for
it but to the King himself, who had given it from no
other Motive than his own Bounty. Now whether
we may suppose that Cardinal <i>Wolsey</i> (as you see
<i>Shakespear</i> has drawn him) would silently have taken
such low Acknowledgments to himself, perhaps may
be as little worth consideration as my mentioning
this Circumstance has been necessary: But if it is
due to the Honour and Integrity of the (then)
Lord-Chamberlain, I cannot think it wholly impertinent.</p>

<p>Since that time there has been but one Play given
at <i>Hampton-Court</i>, which was for the Entertainment
of the Duke of <i>Lorrain</i>; and for which his present
Majesty was pleased to order us a Hundred
Pounds.</p>

<p>The Reader may now plainly see that I am ransacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
my Memory for such remaining Scraps of
Theatrical History as may not perhaps be worth his
Notice: But if they are such as tempt me to write
them, why may I not hope that in this wide World
there may be many an idle Soul, no wiser than my
self, who may be equally tempted to read them?</p>

<p>I have so often had occasion to compare the State
of the Stage to the State of a Nation, that I yet feel
a Reluctancy to drop the Comparison, or speak of
the one without some Application to the other. How
many Reigns, then, do I remember, from that of
<i>Charles</i> the Second, through all which there has been,
from one half of the People or the other, a Succession
of Clamour against every different Ministry for
the time being? And yet, let the Cause of this
Clamour have been never so well grounded, it is
impossible but that some of those Ministers must
have been wiser and honester Men than others: If
this be true, as true I believe it is, why may I not
then say, as some Fool in a <i>French</i> Play does upon
a like Occasion&mdash;<i>Justement, comme chez nous!</i> 'Twas
exactly the same with our Menagement! let us have
done never so well, we could not please every body:
All I can say in our Defence is, that though many
good Judges might possibly conceive how the State
of the Stage might have been mended, yet the best
of them never pretended to remember the Time when
it was better! or could shew us the way to make
their imaginary Amendments practicable.</p>

<p>For though I have often allow'd that our best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Merit as Actors was never equal to that of our Predecessors,
yet I will venture to say, that in all its
Branches the Stage had never been under so just,
so prosperous, and so settled a Regulation, for forty
Years before, as it was at the Time I am speaking
of. The most plausible Objection to our Administration
seemed to be, that we took no Care to breed
up young Actors to succeed us;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and this was imputed
as the greater Fault, because it was taken for
granted that it was a Matter as easy as planting so
many Cabbages: Now, might not a Court as well be
reproached for not breeding up a Succession of complete
Ministers? And yet it is evident, that if Providence
or Nature don't supply us with both, the
State and the Stage will be but poorly supported.
If a Man of an ample Fortune should take it into
his Head to give a younger Son an extraordinary
Allowance in order to breed him a great Poet, what
might we suppose would be the Odds that his Trouble
and Money would be all thrown away? Not more
than it would be against the Master of a Theatre
who should say, this or that young Man I will take
care shall be an excellent Actor! Let it be our
Excuse, then, for that mistaken Charge against us;
that since there was no Garden or Market where
accomplished Actors grew or were to be sold, we
could only pick them up, as we do Pebbles of Va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>lue,
by Chance: We may polish a thousand before we
can find one fit to make a Figure in the Lid of a
Snuff-Box. And how few soever we were able to
produce, it is no Proof that we were not always in
search of them: Yet, at worst, it was allow'd that
our Deficiency of Men Actors was not so visible as
our Scarcity of tolerable Women: But when it is consider'd,
that the Life of Youth and Beauty is too short
for the bringing an Actress to her Perfection; were
I to mention, too, the many frail fair Ones I remember
who, before they could arrive to their Theatrical
Maturity, were feloniously stolen from the Tree, it
would rather be thought our Misfortune than our
Fault that we were not better provided.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Even the Laws of a Nunnery, we find, are thought
no sufficient Security against Temptations without
Iron Grates and high Walls to inforce them; which
the Architecture of a Theatre will not so properly
admit of: And yet, methinks, Beauty that has not
those artificial Fortresses about it, that has no Defence
but its natural Virtue (which upon the Stage
has more than once been met with) makes a much
more meritorious Figure in Life than that immur'd
Virtue which could never be try'd. But alas! as the
poor Stage is but the Show-glass to a Toy-shop, we
must not wonder if now and then some of the Bawbles
should find a Purchaser.</p>

<p>However, as to say more or less than Truth are
equally unfaithful in an Historian, I cannot but own
that, in the Government of the Theatre, I have known
many Instances where the Merit of promising Actors
has not always been brought forward, with the Regard
or Favour it had a Claim to: And if I put my
Reader in mind, that in the early Part of this Work
I have shewn thro' what continued Difficulties and
Discouragements I myself made my way up the Hill
of Preferment, he may justly call it too strong a Glare
of my Vanity: I am afraid he is in the right; but I
pretend not to be one of those chaste Authors that
know how to write without it: When Truth is to be
told, it may be as much Chance as Choice if it
happens to turn out in my Favour: But to shew
that this was true of others as well as myself, <i>Booth</i>
shall be another Instance. In 1707, when <i>Swiney</i>
was the only Master of the Company in the <i>Hay-Market</i>;
<i>Wilks</i>, tho' he was then but an hired Actor
himself, rather chose to govern and give Orders than
to receive them; and was so jealous of <i>Booth</i>'s rising,
that with a high Hand he gave the Part of <i>Pierre</i>,
in <i>Venice Preserv'd</i>, to <i>Mills</i> the elder, who (not to
undervalue him) was out of Sight in the Pretensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
that <i>Booth</i>, then young as he was, had to the same
Part:<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
 and this very Discouragement so strongly
affected him, that not long after, when several of us
became Sharers with <i>Swiney</i>, <i>Booth</i> rat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>her chose to
risque his Fortune with the old Patentee in <i>Drury-Lane</i>,
than come into our Interest, where he saw he
was like to meet with more of those Partialities.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
And yet, again, <i>Booth</i> himself, when he came to be
a Menager, would sometimes suffer his Judgment to
be blinded by his Inclination to Actors whom the
Town seem'd to have but an indifferent Opinion of.
This again inclines me to ask another of my odd
Questions, <i>viz.</i> Have we never seen the same passions
govern a Court! How many white Staffs and great
Places do we find, in our Histories, have been laid at
the Feet of a Monarch, because they chose not to
give way to a Rival in Power, or hold a second
Place in his Favour? How many <i>Whigs</i> and <i>Tories</i>
have chang'd their Parties, when their good or bad
Pretensions have met with a Check to their higher
Preferment?</p>

<p>Thus we see, let the Degrees and Rank of Men be
ever so unequal, Nature throws out their Passions
from the same Motives; 'tis not the Eminence or
Lowliness of either that makes the one, when provok'd,
more or less a reasonable Creature than the
other: The Courtier and the Comedian, when their
Ambition is out of Humour, take just the same
Measures to right themselves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>
<p>If this familiar Stile of talking should, in the
Nostrils of Gravity and Wisdom, smell a little too
much of the Presumptuous or the Pragmatical, I will at
least descend lower in my Apology for it, by calling
to my Assistance the old, humble Proverb, <i>viz.</i> <i>'Tis
an ill Bird that, &amp;c.</i> Why then should I debase
my Profession by setting it in vulgar Lights, when I
may shew it to more favourable Advantages? And
when I speak of our Errors, why may I not extenuate
them by illustrious Examples? or by not allowing
them greater than the greatest Men have been subject
to? Or why, indeed, may I not suppose that a
sensible Reader will rather laugh than look grave at
the Pomp of my Parallels?</p>

<p>Now, as I am tied down to the Veracity of an
Historian whose Facts cannot be supposed, like those
in a Romance, to be in the Choice of the Author to
make them more marvellous by Invention; if I should
happen to sink into a little farther Insignificancy, let
the simple Truth of what I have farther to say, be my
Excuse for it. I am obliged, therefore, to make the
Experiment, by shewing you the Conduct of our
Theatrical Ministry in such Lights as on various
Occasions it appear'd in.</p>

<p>Though <i>Wilks</i> had more Industry and Application
than any Actor I had ever known, yet we found it
possible that those necessary Qualities might sometimes
be so misconducted as not only to make them
useless, but hurtful to our Common-wealth;<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> for while
he was impatient to be foremost in every thing, he
frequently shock'd the honest Ambition of others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
whose Measures might have been more serviceable,
could his Jealousy have given way to them. His
own Regards for himself, therefore, were, to avoid a
disagreeable Dispute with him, too often complied
with: But this leaving his Diligence to his own
Conduct, made us, in some Instances, pay dearly for
it: For Example; he would take as much, or more
Pains, in forwarding to the Stage the Water-gruel
Work of some insipid Author that happen'd rightly
to make his Court to him,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> than he would for the
best Play wherein it was not his Fortune to be
chosen for the best Character. So great was his
Impatience to be employ'd, that I scarce remember,
in twenty Years, above one profitable Play we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
get to be reviv'd, wherein he found he was to make
no considerable Figure, independent of him: But
the <i>Tempest</i> having done Wonders formerly, he
could not form any Pretensions to let it lie longer
dormant: However, his Coldness to it was so visible,
that he took all Occasions to postpone and discourage
its Progress, by frequently taking up the morning-Stage
with something more to his Mind. Having
been myself particularly solicitous for the reviving
this Play, <i>Dogget</i> (for this was before <b>Booth</b> came
into the Menagement) consented that the extraordinary
Decorations and Habits should be left to
my Care and Direction, as the fittest Person whose
Temper could jossle through the petulant Opposition
that he knew <i>Wilks</i> would be always offering to it,
because he had but a middling Part in it, that of
<i>Ferdinand</i>: Notwithstanding which, so it happen'd,
that the Success of it shew'd (not to take from the
Merit of <i>Wilks</i>) that it was possible to have good
Audiences without his extraordinary Assistance. In
the first six Days of acting it we paid all our constant
and incidental Expence, and shar'd each of us a
hundred Pounds: The greatest Profit that in so
little a Time had yet been known within my
Memory! But, alas! what was paltry Pelf to Glory?
That was the darling Passion of <i>Wilks</i>'s Heart! and
not to advance in it was, to so jealous an Ambition,
a painful Retreat, a mere Shade to his Laurels! and
the common Benefit was but a poor Equivalent to
his want of particular Applause! To conclude, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Prince <i>Lewis</i> of <i>Baden</i>, though a Confederate General
with the Duke of <i>Marlborough</i>, was more inconsolable
upon the memorable Victory at <i>Blenheim</i>, at
which he was not present, than our Theatrical Hero
was to see any Action prosperous that he was not
himself at the Head of. If this, then, was an Infirmity
in <i>Wilks</i>, why may not my shewing the same Weakness
in so great a Man mollify the Imputation, and
keep his Memory in Countenance.</p>

<p>This laudable Appetite for Fame in <i>Wilks</i> was
not, however, to be fed without that constant Labour
which only himself was able to come up to: He
therefore bethought him of the means to lessen the
Fatigue, and at the same time to heighten his Reputation;
which was, by giving up now and then a
Part to some raw Actor who he was sure would disgrace
it, and consequently put the Audience in mind
of his superior Performance: Among this sort of Indulgences
to young Actors he happen'd once to make
a Mistake that set his Views in a clear Light. The
best Criticks, I believe, will allow that in <i>Shakespear</i>'s
<i>Macbeth</i> there are, in the Part of <i>Macduff</i>, two Scenes,
the one of Terror, in the second Act, and the other
of Compassion, in the fourth, equal to any that dramatick
Poetry has produc'd: These Scenes <i>Wilks</i>
had acted with Success, tho' far short of that happier
Skill and Grace which <i>Monfort</i> had formerly shewn
in them.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Such a Part, however, one might imagine
would be one of the last a good Actor would chuse
to part with: But <i>Wilks</i> was of a different Opin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>ion;
for <i>Macbeth</i> was thrice as long, had more great Scenes
of Action, and bore the Name of the Play: Now, to
be a second in any Play was what he did not much
care for, and had been seldom us'd to: This Part of
<i>Macduff</i>, therefore, he had given to one <i>Williams</i>, as
yet no extraordinary, though a promising Actor.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
<i>Williams</i>, in the Simplicity of his Heart, immediately
told <i>Booth</i> what a Favour <i>Wilks</i> had done him.
<i>Booth</i>, as he had Reason, thought <i>Wilks</i> had here
carried his Indulgence and his Authority a little too
far; for as <i>Booth</i> had no better a Part in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Play than that of <i>Banquo</i>, he found himself too much
disregarded in letting so young an Actor take Place
of him: <i>Booth</i>, therefore, who knew the Value of
<i>Macduff</i>, proposed to do it himself, and to give
<i>Banquo</i> to <i>Williams</i>; and to make him farther
amends, offer'd him any other of his Parts that he
thought might be of Service to him. <i>Williams</i> was
content with the Exchange, and thankful for the
Promise. This Scheme, indeed, (had it taken Effect)
might have been an Ease to <i>Wilks</i>, and possibly no
Disadvantage to the Play; but softly&mdash;&mdash;That was
not quite what we had a Mind to! No sooner, then,
came this Proposal to <i>Wilks</i>, but off went the Masque
and out came the Secret! For though <i>Wilks</i> wanted
to be eas'd of the Part, he did not desire to be <i>excell'd</i>
in it; and as he was not sure but that might be the
case if <i>Booth</i> were to act it,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> he wisely retracted his
own Project, took <i>Macduff</i> again to himself, and
while he liv'd never had a Thought of running the
same Hazard by any farther Offer to resign it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>
<p>Here I confess I am at a Loss for a Fact in
History to which this can be a Parallel! To be
weary of a Post, even to a real Desire of resigning
it; and yet to chuse rather to drudge on in it than
suffer it to be well supplied (though to share in that
Advantage) is a Delicacy of Ambition that <i>Machiavil</i>
himself has made no mention of: Or if in old <i>Rome</i>,
the Jealousy of any pretended Patriot equally inclin'd
to abdicate his Office may have come up to it, 'tis
more than my reading remembers.</p>

<p>As nothing can be more impertinent than shewing
too frequent a Fear to be thought so, I will, without
farther Apology, rather risque that Imputation than
not tell you another Story much to the same purpose,
and of no more consequence than my last. To
make you understand it, however, a little Preface
will be necessary.</p>

<p>If the Merit of an Actor (as it certainly does) consists
more in the Quality than the Quantity of his
Labour; the other Menagers had no visible Reason
to think this needless Ambition of <i>Wilks</i>, in being
so often and sometimes so unnecessarily employ'd,
gave him any Title to a Superiority; especially when
our Articles of Agreement had allow'd us all to be
equal. But what are narrow Contracts to great Souls
with growing Desires? <i>Wilks</i>, therefore, who thought
himself lessen'd in appealing to any Judgment but
his own, plainly discovered by his restless Behaviour
(though he did not care to speak out) that he thought
he had a Right to some higher Consideration for his
Performance: This was often <i>Booth</i>'s Opinio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>n, as
well as my own. It must be farther observ'd, that
he actually had a separate Allowance of Fifty Pounds
a Year for writing our daily Play-Bills for the
Printer: Which Province, to say the Truth, was the
only one we car'd to trust to his particular Intendance,
or could find out for a Pretence to distinguish
him. But, to speak a plainer Truth, this Pension,
which was no part of our original Agreement, was
merely paid to keep him quiet, and not that we
thought it due to so insignificant a Charge as what a
Prompter had formerly executed. This being really
the Case, his frequent Complaints of being a Drudge
to the Company grew something more than disagreeable
to us: For we could not digest the Imposition
of a Man's setting himself to work, and then
bringing in his own Bill for it. <i>Booth</i>, therefore, who
was less easy than I was to see him so often setting
a Merit upon this Quantity of his Labour, which
neither could be our Interest or his own to lay upon
him, proposed to me that we might remove this pretended
Grievance by reviving some Play that might
be likely to live, and be easily acted, without <i>Wilks</i>'s
having any Part in it. About this time an unexpected
Occasion offer'd itself to put our Project in
practice: What follow'd our Attempt will be all (if
any thing be) worth Observation in my Story.</p>

<p>In 1725 we were call'd upon, in a manner that
could not be resisted, to revive the <i>Provok'd Wife</i>,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
a Comedy which, while we found our Account i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>n
keeping the Stage clear of those loose Liberties it
had formerly too justly been charg'd with, we had
laid aside for some Years.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The Author, Sir <i>John
Vanbrugh</i>, who was conscious of what it had too
much of, was prevail'd upon<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> to substitute a new-written
Scene in the Place of one in the fourth
Act, where the Wantonness of his Wit and Humour
had (originally) made a Rake<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> talk like a Rake
in the borrow'd Habit of a Clergyman: To avoid
which Offence, he clapt the same Debauchee into
the Undress of a Woman of Quality: Now the
Character and Profession of a Fine Lady not
being so indelibly sacred as that of a Churchman,
whatever Follies he expos'd in the Petticoat kept
him at least clear of his former Prophaneness,
and were now innocently ridiculous to the Spectator.</p>

<p>This Play being thus refitted for the Stage, was, as
I have observ'd, call'd for from Court and by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>many
of the Nobility.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Now, then, we thought, was a
proper time to come to an Explanation with <i>Wilks</i>:
Accordingly, when the Actors were summon'd to
hear the Play read and receive their Parts, I address'd
myself to <i>Wilks</i>, before them all, and told
him, That as the Part of <i>Constant</i>, which he seem'd
to chuse, was a Character of less Action than he
generally appear'd in, we thought this might be a
good Occasion to ease himself by giving it to
another.&mdash;Here he look'd grave.&mdash;That the Love-Scenes
of it were rather serious than gay or humourous,
and therefore might sit very well upon <i>Booth</i>.&mdash;&mdash;Down
dropt his Brow, and furl'd were his Features.&mdash;That
if we were never to revive a tolerable
Play without him, what would become of us in case
of his Indisposition?&mdash;&mdash;Here he pretended to stir
the Fire.&mdash;That as he could have no farther Advantage
or Advancement in his Station to hope for, his
acting in this Play was but giving himself an unprofitable
Trouble, which neither <i>Booth</i> or I desired to
impose upon him.&mdash;Softly.&mdash;Now the Pill began to
gripe him.&mdash;&mdash;In a Word, this provoking Civility
plung'd him into a Passion which he was no longer
able to contain; out it came, with all the Equipage
of unlimited Language that on such Occasions his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Displeasure usually set out with; but when his
Reply was stript of those Ornaments, it was plainly
this: That he look'd upon all I had said as a concerted
Design, not only to signalize our selves by
laying him aside, but a Contrivance to draw him into
the Disfavour of the Nobility, by making it suppos'd
his own Choice that he did not act in a Play so particularly
ask'd for; but we should find he could
stand upon his own Bottom, and it was not all our
little caballing should get our Ends of him: To which
I answer'd with some Warmth, That he was mistaken
in our Ends; for Those, Sir, said I, you have answer'd
already by shewing the Company you cannot
bear to be left out of any Play. Are not you every
Day complaining of your being over-labour'd? And
now, upon our first offering to ease you, you fly into
a Passion, and pretend to make that a greater Grievance
than t'other: But, Sir, if your being In or Out
of the Play is a Hardship, you shall impose it upon
yourself: The Part is in your Hand, and to us it is
a Matter of Indifference now whether you take it or
leave it. Upon this he threw down the Part upon
the Table, cross'd his Arms, and sate knocking his
Heel upon the Floor, as seeming to threaten most
when he said least; but when no body persuaded
him to take it up again, <i>Booth</i>, not chusing to push
the matter too far, but rather to split the difference
of our Dispute, said, That, for his Part, he saw no
such great matter in acting every Day; for he believed
it the wholsomest Exercise in the World; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
kept the Spirits in motion, and always gave him a
good Stomach. Though this was, in a manner,
giving up the Part to <i>Wilks</i>, yet it did not allow he
did us any Favour in receiving it. Here I observ'd
Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i> began to titter behind her Fan: But
<i>Wilks</i> being more intent upon what <i>Booth</i> had said,
reply'd, Every one could best feel for himself, but he
did not pretend to the Strength of a Pack-horse;
therefore if Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i> would chuse any body else
to play with her,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> he should be very glad to be
excus'd: This throwing the Negative upon Mrs.
<i>Oldfield</i> was, indeed, a sure way to save himself;
which I could not help taking notice of, by saying, It
was making but an ill Compliment to the Company
to suppose there was but one Man in it fit to play
an ordinary Part with her. Here Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i> got
up, and turning me half round to come forward, said
with her usual Frankness, Pooh! you are all a
Parcel of Fools, to make such a rout about nothing!
Rightly judging that the Person most out of humour
would not be more displeas'd at her calling us all by
the same Name. As she knew, too, the best way of
ending the Debate would be to help the Weak; she
said, she hop'd Mr. <i>Wilks</i> would not so far mind
what had past as to refuse his acting the Part with
her; for tho' it might not be so good as he had been
us'd to, yet she believed those who had bespoke the
Play would expect to have it done to the best
Advantage, and it would make but an odd Story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
abroad if it were known there had been any Difficulty
in that point among ourselves. To conclude,
<i>Wilks</i> had the Part, and we had all we wanted;
which was an Occasion to let him see, that the Accident
or Choice of one Menager's being more employ'd
than another would never be allow'd a Pretence for
altering our Indentures, or his having an extraordinary
Consideration for it.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>However disagreeable it might be to have this
unsociable Temper daily to deal with; yet I cannot
but say, that from the same impatient Spirit that had
so often hurt us, we still drew valuable Advantages:
For as <i>Wilks</i> seem'd to have no Joy in Life beyond
his being distinguish'd on the Stage, we were not
only sure of his always doing his best there himself,
but of making others more careful than without the
Rod of so irascible a Temper over them they would
have been. And I much question if a more temperate
or better Usage of the hired Actors could have
so effectually kept them to Order. Not even <i>Betterton</i>
(as we have seen) with all his good Sense, his
great Fame and Experience, could, by being only a
quiet Example of Industry himself, save his Company
from falling, while neither Gentleness could
govern or the Consideration of their common Interest
reform them.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Diligence, with much the inferior
Skill or Capacity, will beat the best negligent Company
that ever came upon a Stage. But when a cert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>ain
dreaming Idleness or jolly Negligence of Rehearsals
gets into a Body of the Ignorant and
Incapable (which before <i>Wilks</i> came into <i>Drury-Lane</i>,
when <i>Powel</i> was at the Head of them, was the
Case of that Company) then, I say, a sensible Spectator
might have look'd upon the fallen Stage as
<i>Portius</i> in the Play of <i>Cato</i> does upon his ruin'd
Country, and have lamented it in (something near)
the same Exclamation, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>&mdash;O ye Immortal Bards!</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>What Havock do these Blockheads make among your Works!</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>How are the boasted Labours of an Age</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Defac'd and tortured by Ungracious Action?</i>
<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Of this wicked Doings <i>Dryden</i>, too, complains in one
of his Prologues at that time, where, speaking of
such lewd Actors, he closes a Couplet with the
following Line, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><i>And murder Plays, which they miscall Reviving.</i><a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The great Share, therefore, that <i>Wilks</i>, by his exemplary
Diligence and Impatience of Neglect in
others, had in the Reformation of this Evil, ought in
Justice to be remember'd; and let my own Vanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
here take Shame to itself when I confess, That had
I had half his Application, I still think I might have
shewn myself twice the Actor that in my highest
State of Favour I appear'd to be. But if I have
any Excuse for that Neglect (a Fault which, if I
loved not Truth, I need not have mentioned) it is
that so much of my Attention was taken up in an
incessant Labour to guard against our private Animosities,
and preserve a Harmony in our Menagement,
that I hope and believe it made ample Amends
for whatever Omission my Auditors might sometimes
know it cost me some pains to conceal. But Nature
takes care to bestow her Blessings with a more equal
Hand than Fortune does, and is seldom known to
heap too many upon one Man: One tolerable Talent
in an Individual is enough to preserve him from
being good for nothing; and, if that was not laid to
my Charge as an Actor, I have in this Light too, less
to complain of than to be thankful for.</p>

<p>Before I conclude my History, it may be expected
I should give some further View of these my last
Cotemporaries of the Theatre, <i>Wilks</i> and <i>Booth</i>, in
their different acting Capacities. If I were to paint
them in the Colours they laid upon one another, their
Talents would not be shewn with half the Commendation
I am inclined to bestow upon them, when they
are left to my own Opinion. But People of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
same Profession are apt to see themselves in their
own clear Glass of Partiality, and look upon their
Equals through a Mist of Prejudice. It might be
imagin'd, too, from the difference of their natural
Tempers, that <i>Wilks</i> should have been more blind
to the Excellencies of <i>Booth</i> than <i>Booth</i> was to those
of <i>Wilks</i>; but it was not so: <i>Wilks</i> would sometimes
commend <i>Booth</i> to me; but when <i>Wilks</i> excell'd, the
other was silent:<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> <i>Booth</i> seem'd to think nothing
valuable that was not tragically Great or Marvellous:
Let that be as true as it may; yet I have often
thought that, from his having no Taste of Humour
himself,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> he might be too much inclin'd to depreciate
the Acting of it in others. The very slight Opinion
which in private Conversation with me he had of
<i>Wilks</i>'s acting Sir <i>Harry Wildair</i>, was certainly more
than could be justified; not only from the general
Applause that was against that Opinion (tho' Applau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>se
is not always infallible) but from the visible
Capacity which must be allow'd to an Actor, that
could carry such slight Materials to such a height of
Approbation: For, though the Character of <i>Wildair</i>
scarce in any one Scene will stand against a just
Criticism; yet in the Whole there are so many gay
and false Colours of the fine Gentleman, that nothing
but a Vivacity in the Performance proportionably
extravagant could have made them so happily glare
upon a common Audience.</p>

<p><i>Wilks</i>, from his first setting out, certainly form'd
his manner of Acting upon the Model of <i>Monfort</i>;<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
as <i>Booth</i> did his on that of <i>Betterton</i>. But&mdash;&mdash;<i>Haud
passibus √¶quis</i>: I cannot say either of them came up
to their Original. <i>Wilks</i> had not that easy regulated
Behaviour, or the harmonious Elocution of the One,
nor <i>Booth</i> that Conscious Aspect of Intelligence nor
requisite Variation of Voice that made every Line
the Other spoke seem his own natural self-deliver'd
Sentiment: Yet there is still room for great Commendation
of Both the first mentioned; which will
not be so much diminish'd in my having said they
were only excell'd by such Predecessors, as it will be
rais'd in venturing to affirm it will be a longer time
before any Successors will come near them. Thus
one of the greatest Praises given to <i>Virgil</i> is, that
no Successor in Poetry came so near <i>Him</i> as <i>H<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>e</i>
himself did to <i>Homer</i>.</p>

<p>Though the Majority of Publick Auditors are but
bad judges of Theatrical Action, and are often deceiv'd
into their Approbation of what has no solid
Pretence to it; yet, as there are no other appointed
Judges to appeal to, and as every single Spectator
has a Right to be one of them, their Sentence will
be definitive, and the Merit of an Actor must, in
some degree, be weigh'd by it: By this Law, then,
<i>Wilks</i> was pronounced an Excellent Actor; which,
if the few true Judges did not allow him to be, they
were at least too candid to slight or discourage him.
<i>Booth</i> and he were Actors so directly opposite in
their Manner, that if either of them could have borrowed
a little of the other's Fault, they would Both
have been improv'd by it: If <i>Wilks</i> had sometimes
too violent a Vivacity; <i>Booth</i> as often contented
himself with too grave a Dignity: The Latter seem'd
too much to heave up his Words, as the other to
dart them to the Ear with too quick and sharp a
Vehemence: Thus <i>Wilks</i> would too frequently break
into the Time and Measure of the Harmony by too
many spirited Accents in one Line; and <i>Booth</i>, by too
solemn a Regard to Harmony, would as often lose
the necessary Spirit of it: So that (as I have observ'd)
could we have sometimes rais'd the one and
sunk the other, they had both been nearer to the
mark. Yet this could not be always objected to
them: They had their Intervals of unexceptionable
Excellence, that more than balanc'd their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>Errors.
The Master-piece of <i>Booth</i> was <i>Othello</i>: There he
was most in Character, and seemed not more to animate
or please himself in it than his Spectators. 'Tis
true he owed his last and highest Advancement to
his acting <i>Cato</i>: But it was the Novelty and critical
Appearance of that Character that chiefly swell'd the
Torrent of his Applause: For let the Sentiments of
a declaiming Patriot have all the Sublimity that
Poetry can raise them to; let them be deliver'd, too,
with the utmost Grace and Dignity of Elocution that
can recommend them to the Auditor: Yet this is
but one Light wherein the Excellence of an Actor
can shine: But in <i>Othello</i> we may see him in the
Variety of Nature: There the Actor is carried
through the different Accidents of domestick Happiness
and Misery, occasionally torn and tortur'd by
the most distracting Passion that can raise Terror
or Compassion in the Spectator. Such are the
Characters that a Master Actor would delight in;
and therefore in <i>Othello</i> I may safely aver that <i>Booth</i>
shew'd himself thrice the Actor that he could in <i>Cato</i>.
And yet his Merit in acting <i>Cato</i> need not be diminish'd
by this Comparison.</p>

<p><i>Wilks</i> often regretted that in Tragedy he had not
the full and strong Voice of <i>Booth</i> to command and
grace his Periods with: But <i>Booth</i> us'd to say, That
if his Ear had been equal to it, <i>Wilks</i> had Voice
enough to have shewn himself a much better Tragedian.
Now, though there might be some Truth in
this; yet these two Actors were of so mixt a Merit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
that even in Tragedy the Superiority was not always
on the same side: In Sorrow, Tenderness, or Resignation,
<i>Wilks</i> plainly had the Advantage, and seem'd
more pathetically to feel, look, and express his Calamity:
But in the more turbulent Transports of the
Heart, <i>Booth</i> again bore the Palm, and left all Competitors
behind him. A Fact perhaps will set this
Difference in a clearer Light. I have formerly seen
<i>Wilks</i> act <i>Othello</i>,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and <i>Booth</i> the <i>Earl of Essex</i>,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> in
which they both miscarried: Neither the exclamatory
Rage or Jealousy of the one, or the plaintive Distresses
of the other, were happily executed, or became
either of them; though in the contrary Characters
they were both excellent.</p>

<p>When an Actor becomes and naturally Looks the
Character he stands in, I have often observ'd it to
have had as fortunate an Effect, and as much recommended
him to the Approbation of the common
Auditors, as the most correct or judicious Utterance
of the Sentiments: This was strongly visible in the
favourable Reception <i>Wilks</i> met with in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span><i>Hamlet</i>,
where I own the Half of what he spoke was as painful
to my Ear as every Line that came from <i>Betterton</i>
was charming;<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and yet it is not impossible,
could they have come to a Poll, but <i>Wilks</i> might
have had a Majority of Admirers: However, such a
Division had been no Proof that the Pr√¶eminence
had not still remain'd in <i>Betterton</i>; and if I should
add that <i>Booth</i>, too, was behind <i>Betterton</i> in <i>Othello</i>,
it would be saying no more than <i>Booth</i> himself had
Judgment and Candour enough to know and confess.
And if both he and <i>Wilks</i> are allow'd, in the two
above-mention'd Characters, a second Place to so
great a Master as <i>Betterton</i>, it will be a Rank of
Praise that the best Actors since my Time might
have been proud of.</p>

<p>I am now come towards the End of that Time
through which our Affairs had long gone forward in
a settled Course of Prosperity. From the Visible
Errors of former Menagements we had at last found
the necessary Means to bring our private Laws and
Orders into the general Observance and Approbation
of our Society: Diligence and Neglect were
under an equal Eye; the one never fail'd of its
Reward, and the other, by being very rarely excus'd,
was less frequently committed. You are now to
consider us in our height of Favour, and so much in
fashion with the politer Part of the Town, that our
House every <i>Saturday</i> seem'd to be the appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>ed
Assembly of the First Ladies of Quality: Of this,
too, the common Spectators were so well appriz'd,
that for twenty Years successively, on that Day, we
scarce ever fail'd of a crowded Audience; for which
Occasion we particularly reserv'd our best Plays,
acted in the best Manner we could give them.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Among our many necessary Reformations; what
not a little preserv'd to us the Regard of our Auditors,
was the Decency of our clear Stage;<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> from
whence we had now, for many Years, shut out those
idle Gentlemen, who seem'd more delighted to be
pretty Objects themselves, than capable of any Pleasure
from the Play: Who took their daily Stands
where they might best elbow the Actor, and come
in for their Share of the Auditor's Attention. In
many a labour'd Scene of the warmest Humour and
of the most affecting Passion have I seen the best
Actors disconcerted, while these buzzing Muscatos
have been fluttering round their Eyes and Ears.
How was it possible an Actor, so embarrass'd, should
keep his Impatience from entering into that different
Temper which his personated Character might require
him to be Master of?</p>

<p>Future Actors may perhaps wish I would set this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Grievance in a stronger Light; and, to say the Truth,
where Auditors are ill-bred, it cannot well be expected
that Actors should be polite. Let me therefore
shew how far an Artist in any Science is apt to
be hurt by any sort of Inattention to his Performance.</p>

<p>While the famous <i>Corelli</i>,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> at <i>Rome</i>, was playing
some Musical Composition of his own to a select
Company in the private Apartment of his Patron-Cardinal,
he observed, in the height of his Harmony,
his Eminence was engaging in a detach'd Conversation;
upon which he suddenly stopt short, and gently
laid down his Instrument: The Cardinal, surpriz'd
at the unexpected Cessation, ask'd him if a String
was broke? To which <i>Corelli</i>, in an honest Conscience
of what was due to his Musick, reply'd, No,
Sir, I was only afraid I interrupted Business. His
Eminence, who knew that a Genius could never
shew itself to Advantage where it had not its proper
Regards, took this Reproof in good Part, and broke
off his Conversation to hear the whole <i>Concerto</i> play'd
over again.</p>

<p>Another Story will let us see what Effect a mistaken
Offence of this kind had upon the <i>French</i>
Theatre; which was told me by a Gentleman of the
long Robe, then at <i>Paris</i>, and who was himself the innocent
Author of it. At the Tragedy of <i>Zaire</i>, while
the celebrated Mademoiselle <i>Gossin</i><a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>was delivering a
Soliloquy, this Gentleman was seiz'd with a sudden
Fit of Coughing, which gave the Actress some Surprize
and Interruption; and his Fit increasing, she
was forced to stand silent so long, that it drew the
Eyes of the uneasy Audience upon him; when a
<i>French</i> Gentleman, leaning forward to him, ask'd him,
If this Actress had given him any particular Offence,
that he took so publick an Occasion to resent it?
The <i>English</i> Gentleman, in the utmost Surprize,
assured him, So far from it, that he was a particular
Admirer of her Performance; that his Malady was
his real Misfortune, and if he apprehended any
Return of it, he would rather quit his Seat than disoblige
either the Actress or the Audience.</p>

<p>This publick Decency in their Theatre I have
myself seen carried so far, that a Gentleman in their
<i>second Loge</i>, or Middle-Gallery, being observ'd to sit
forward himself while a Lady sate behind him, a
loud Number of Voices call'd out to him from the
Pit, <i>Place √† la Dame!</i> <i>Place √† la Dame!</i> When the
Person so offending, either not apprehending the
Meaning of the Clamour, or possibly being some
<i>John Trott</i> who fear'd no Man alive; the Noise was
continued for several Minutes; nor were the Actors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
though ready on the Stage, suffer'd to begin the Play
'till this unbred Person was laugh'd out of his Seat,
and had placed the Lady before him.</p>

<p>Whether this Politeness observ'd at Plays may
be owing to their Clime, their Complexion, or their
Government, is of no great Consequence; but if it
is to be acquired, methinks it is pity our accomplish'd
Countrymen, who every Year import so much
of this Nation's gawdy Garniture, should not, in
this long Course of our Commerce with them, have
brought over a little of their Theatrical Good-breeding
too.</p>

<p>I have been the more copious upon this Head,
that it might be judg'd how much it stood us upon
to have got rid of those improper Spectators I have
been speaking of: For whatever Regard we might
draw by keeping them at a Distance from our Stage,
I had observed, while they were admitted behind
our Scenes, we but too often shew'd them the wrong
Side of our Tapestry; and that many a tolerable
Actor was the less valued when it was known what
ordinary Stuff he was made of.</p>

<p>Among the many more disagreeable Distresses
that are almost unavoidable in the Government of a
Theatre, those we so often met with from the Persecution
of bad Authors were what we could never intirely
get rid of. But let us state both our Cases, and
then see where the Justice of the Complaint lies.
'Tis true, when an ingenious Indigent had taken
perhaps a whole Summer's Pains, <i>invit√¢ <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>Minerv√¢</i>,
to heap up a Pile of Poetry into the Likeness of a
Play, and found, at last, the gay Promise of his
Winter's Support was rejected and abortive, a Man
almost ought to be a Poet himself to be justly sensible
of his Distress! Then, indeed, great Allowances
ought to be made for the severe Reflections
he might naturally throw upon those pragmatical
Actors, who had no Sense or Taste of good Writing.
And yet, if his Relief was only to be had by his
imposing a bad Play upon a good Set of Actors,
methinks the Charity that first looks at home has as
good an Excuse for its Coldness as the unhappy
Object of it had a Plea for his being reliev'd at their
Expence. But immediate Want was not always confess'd
their Motive for Writing; Fame, Honour, and
<i>Parnassian</i> Glory had sometimes taken a romantick
Turn in their Heads; and then they gave themselves
the Air of talking to us in a higher Strain&mdash;Gentlemen
were not to be so treated! the Stage was like
to be finely govern'd when Actors pretended to be
Judges of Authors, &amp;<i>c.</i> But, dear Gentlemen! if they
were good Actors, why not? How should they have
been able to act, or rise to any Excellence, if you supposed
them not to feel or understand what you
offer'd them? Would you have reduc'd them to the
meer Mimickry of Parrots and Monkies, that can only
prate, and play a great many pretty Tricks, without
Reflection? Or how are you sure your Friend, the
infallible Judge to whom you read your fine Piece,
might be sincere in the Praises he gave it? Or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
indeed, might not you have thought the best Judge
a bad one if he had disliked it? Consider, too, how
possible it might be that a Man of Sense would not
care to tell you a Truth he was sure you would not
believe! And if neither <i>Dryden</i>, <i>Congreve</i>, <i>Steele</i>,
<i>Addison</i>, nor <i>Farquhar</i>, (if you please) ever made
any Complaint of their Incapacity to judge, why is
the World to believe the Slights you have met with
from them are either undeserved or particular? Indeed!
indeed, I am not conscious that we ever did
you or any of your Fraternity the least Injustice!<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
Yet this was not all we had to struggle with; to
supersede our Right of rejecting, the Recommendation,
or rather Imposition, of some great Persons
(whom it was not Prudence to disoblige) sometimes
came in with a high Hand to support their Preten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>sions;
and then, <i>cout que cout</i>, acted it must be! So
when the short Life of this wonderful Nothing was
over, the Actors were perhaps abus'd in a Preface
for obstructing the Success of it, and the Town
publickly damn'd us for our private Civility.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>I cannot part with these fine Gentlemen Authors
without mentioning a ridiculous <i>Disgraccia</i> that befel
one of them many Years ago: This solemn Bard,
who, like <i>Bays</i>, only writ for Fame and Reputation;
on the second Day's publick Triumph of his Muse,
marching in a stately full-bottom'd Perriwig into the
Lobby of the House, with a Lady of Condition in
his Hand, when raising his Voice to the Sir <i>Fopling</i>
Sound, that <i>became the Mouth of a Man of Qual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>ity</i>,
and calling out&mdash;Hey! Box-keeper, where is my
Lady such-a-one's Servant, was unfortunately answer'd
by honest <i>John Trott</i>, (which then happen'd
to be the Box-keeper's real Name) Sir, we have dismiss'd,
there was not Company enough to pay
Candles. In which mortal Astonishment it may be
sufficient to leave him. And yet had the Actors
refus'd this Play, what Resentment might have been
thought too severe for them?</p>

<p>Thus was our Administration often censured for
Accidents which were not in our Power to prevent:
A possible Case in the wisest Governments. If,
therefore, some Plays have been preferr'd to the
Stage that were never fit to have been seen there,
let this be our best Excuse for it. And yet, if the
Merit of our rejecting the many bad Plays that
press'd hard upon us were weigh'd against the
few that were thus imposed upon us, our Conduct in
general might have more Amendments of the Stage
to boast of than Errors to answer for. But it is now
Time to drop the Curtain.</p>

<p>During our four last Years there happen'd so very
little unlike what has been said before, that I shall
conclude with barely mentioning those unavoidable
Accidents that drew on our Dissolution. The first,
that for some Years had led the way to greater, was
the continued ill State of Health that render'd <i>Booth</i><a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
incapable of appearing on the Stage. The next was
the Death of Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i>,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> which happen'd on the
23d of <i>October</i>, 1730. About the same Time, t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>oo,
Mrs. <i>Porter</i>, then in her highest Reputation for
Tragedy, was lost to us by the Misfortune of a dislocated
Limb from the overturning of a <i>Chaise</i>.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> And
our last Stroke was the Death of <i>Wilks</i>, in <i>September</i>
the Year following, 1731.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding such irreparable Losses; whether,
when these favourite Actors were no more to be
had, their Successors might not be better born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
with than they could possibly have hop'd while the
former were in being; or that the generality of
Spectators, from their want of Taste, were easier to
be pleas'd than the few that knew better: Or that,
at worst, our Actors were still preferable to any
other Company of the several then subsisting: Or to
whatever Cause it might be imputed, our Audiences
were far less abated than our Apprehensions had
suggested. So that, though it began to grow late in
Life with me; having still Health and Strength
enough to have been as useful on the Stage as ever,
I was under no visible Necessity of quitting it: But
so it happen'd that our surviving Fraternity having
got some chim√¶rical, and, as I thought, unjust
Notions into their Heads, which, though I knew they
were without much Difficulty to be surmounted; I
chose not, at my time of Day, to enter into new Contentions;
and as I found an Inclination in some of
them to purchase the whole Power of the Patent
into their own Hands; I did my best while I staid
with them to make it worth their while to come up
to my Price; and then patiently sold out my Share to
the first Bidder, wishing the Crew I had left in the
Vessel a good Voyage.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>What Commotions the Stage fell into the Year

Part of the Actors revolted, and set up for themselves
in the little House in the <i>Hay-Market</i>, lies
not within the Promise of my Title Page to relate:
Or, as it might set some Persons living in a Light
they possibly might not chuse to be seen in, I will
rather be thankful for the involuntary Favour they
have done me, than trouble the Publick with private
Complaints of fancied or real Injuries.</p>

<small>BY ROBERT W. LOWE.</small></h2>


<p>The transaction to which Cibber alludes in his
last paragraph is one with regard to which he
probably felt that his conduct required some explanation.
After the death of Steele, a Patent was
granted to Cibber, Wilks, and Booth, empowering
them to give plays at Drury Lane, or elsewhere, for a
period of twenty-one years from 1st September, 1732.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Just after it came into operation Wilks died, and his
share in the Patent became the property of his wife.
Booth, shortly before his death, which occurred in
May, 1733, sold half of his share for ¬£2,500, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
John Highmore, a gentleman who seems to have
been a typical amateur manager, being possessed of
some money, no judgment, and unbounded vanity.
In making this purchase Highmore stipulated that,
with half of Booth's share, he should receive the
whole of his authority; and he accordingly exercised
the same power of control as had belonged to Booth.
Mrs. Wilks deputed Mr. John Ellys, the painter, to
be her representative, so that Cibber had to manage
the affairs of the theatre in conjunction with a couple
of amateurs, both ignorant, and one certainly presumptuous
also. He delegated his authority for
a time to his scapegrace son, Theophilus, who probably
made himself so objectionable that Highmore
was glad to buy the father's share in the Patent also.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
He paid three thousand guineas for it, thus purchasing
a whole share for a sum not much exceeding that
which he had paid for one-half. Highmore's first purchase
took place in the autumn of 1732, his second
somewhere about May, 1733; so that, when Drury
Lane opened for the season 1733-34, he possessed
one-half of the three shares into which the Patent
was divided. Mrs. Wilks retained her share, but Mrs.
Booth had sold her remaining half-share to Hen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>ry
Giffard,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre,
at which, eight years later, Garrick made his first
appearance. Highmore had scarcely entered upon
his fuller authority when a revolt was spirited up
among his actors, the chief of whom left him in a
body to open the little theatre in the Haymarket.
Shameful to relate, the ringleader in this mutiny was
Theophilus Cibber; and, what is still more disgraceful,
Colley Cibber lent them his active countenance.
Benjamin Victor, though a devoted friend of Colley
Cibber, characterizes the transaction as most dishonest,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy
of his information or the soundness of his judgment.
Davies ("Life of Garrick," i. 76) states that Colley
Cibber applied to the Duke of Grafton, then Lord
Chamberlain, for a new License or Patent in favour
of his son; but the Duke, on inquiring into the
matter, was so disgusted at Cibber's conduct that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
refused the application with strong expressions of
disapprobation. The seceders had of course no
Patent or License under which to act; but, from the
circumstance that they took the name of Comedians
of His Majesty's Revels, it is probable that they received
a License from the Master of the Revels,
Charles Henry Lee. Highmore, deserted by every
actor of any importance except Miss Raftor (Mrs.
Clive), Mrs. Horton, and Bridgwater, was at his
wits' end. He summoned the seceders for an
infringement of his Patent, but his case, tried on
5th November, 1733, was dismissed, apparently on
some technical plea. He could not prevail upon the
Lord Chamberlain to exert his authority to close the
Haymarket, so he determined to try the efficacy of
the Vagrant Act (12 Queen Anne) against the
irregular performers. John Harper accordingly was
arrested on 12th November, 1733, and committed to
Bridewell. On the 20th of the same month he was
tried before the Court of King's Bench as a rogue
and vagabond; but, whether from the circumstance
that Harper was a householder, or from a decision
that playing at the Haymarket was not an act of
vagrancy,<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> he was discharged upon his own recognizance,
and the manager's action failed. He had
therefore to bring actors from the country to make
up his company; but of these Macklin was the only
one who proved of any assistance, and the unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Highmore, after meeting deficiencies of fifty or sixty
pounds each week for some months, was forced to
give up the struggle.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Another amateur then stepped
into the breach&mdash;Charles Fleetwood, who purchased
the shares of Highmore and Mrs. Wilks for little
more than the former had paid for his own portion.
Giffard seems to have retained his sixth of the
Patent. Fleetwood first set about regaining the
services of the seceders, and, as the majority of them
were probably ashamed of following the leadership
of Theophilus Cibber, he succeeded at once. The
last performance at the Haymarket took place on
9th March, 1734, and on the 12th the deserters reappeared
on Drury Lane stage. This transaction
ended Colley Cibber's direct interference in the
affairs of the theatre, and his only subsequent connection
with the stage was as an actor. His first
appearance after his retirement was on 31st October,
1734, when he played his great character of Bayes.
During the season he acted Lord Foppington, Sir
John Brute, Sir Courtly Nice, and Sir Fopling
Flutter; and on 26th February, 1735, he appeared
as Fondlewife for the benefit of his old friend and
partner, Owen Swiney.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> At the end of the se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>ason
1734-5, an arrangement was under consideration by
which a committee of actors, including Mills, Johnson,
Miller, Theo. Cibber, Mrs. Heron, Mrs. Butler,
and others, were to rent Drury Lane from Fleetwood,
for fifteen years, at ¬£920 per annum; but the arrangement
does not appear to have been carried
out, and Fleetwood continued Patentee of Drury
Lane until 1744-5.</p>

<p>The rival company, under the control of John
Rich, acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields from 18th December,
1714, to 5th December, 1732; then they
removed to the new Covent Garden Theatre, which
was opened on 7th December with "The Way of
the World." For several seasons both companies
dragged along very uneventfully, so far as the artistic
advancement of the stage was concerned, although
the passing of the Licensing Act of 1737, already
fully commented on, was an event of great historical
importance. Artistically the period was one of rest,
if not of retrogression; the methods of the older
time were losing their meaning and vitality, and
were becoming mere dry bones of tradition. The
high priest of the stage was James Quin, a great
actor, though not of the first order; and among the
younger players perhaps the most notable was Charles
Macklin, rough in manner as in person, but full of
genius and a thorough reformer. Garrick was the
direct means of revolutionizing the methods of the
theatre, and it was his genius that swept away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
formality and dulness of the old school; but it ought
to be remembered that the way was prepared for
him by Charles Macklin, whose rescue of Shylock
from low comedy was an achievement scarcely inferior
to Garrick's greatest. During this dull period
Cibber's appearances must have had an importance
and interest, which, after Garrick's advent, they
lacked.</p>

<p>In the season 1735-6 he acted Sir Courtly Nice
and Bayes, and in the next season his play of "Papal
Tyranny in the Reign of King John," a miserable
mutilation of Shakespeare's "King John," was put
in rehearsal at Drury Lane. But such a storm of
ridicule and abuse arose when this play was announced,
that Cibber withdrew it,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and it was not seen till
1745, when, the nation being in fear of a Popish
Pretender, it was produced at Covent Garden from
patriotic motives.</p>

<p>Cibber's implacable foe, Fielding, was one of the
ringleaders in the attack on him for mutilating
Shakespeare; and in his "Historical Register for
1736,"<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> in which Colley is introduced as "Ground-Ivy,"<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
gives him the following excellent rebuke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Medley.</i> As <i>Shakspear</i> is already g<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>ood enough
for People of Taste, he must be alter'd to the Palates
of those who have none; and if you will grant that,
who can be properer to alter him for the worse?"</p>

<p>In 1738, having, as Victor says ("History," ii. 48),
"Health and Strength enough to be as useful as
ever," he agreed with Fleetwood to perform a round
of his favourite characters. He was successful in
comedy, but in tragedy he felt that his strength was
no longer sufficient; and Victor relates that, going
behind the scenes while the third act of "Richard III."
was on, he was told in a whisper by the old man,
"That he would give fifty Guineas to be then sitting
in his easy Chair by his own Fire-side." Probably
he never played in tragedy again until the production
of his own "Papal Tyranny"&mdash;at least I cannot discover
that he did. In 1740-1 he acted Fondlewife
for the benefit of Chetwood, late prompter at Dru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>ry
Lane, who was then imprisoned in the King's Bench
for debt; and his reception was so favourable that
he repeated the character a second and third time
for his own profit.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Upon these occasions he spoke
an "Epilogue upon Himself," which is given in "The
Egotist" (p. 57 <i>et seq.</i>), and forms so good an epitome
of Cibber's philosophy, besides giving an excellent
specimen of his style, that I quote it at length:&mdash;</p>

to in this Epilogue was Mrs. Woffington, with whom
stage-history has identified the "Susannah" of the
following well-known anecdote, which I quote from
an attack upon Cibber, published in 1742, entitled "A
Blast upon <i>Bays</i>; or, A New Lick at the Laureat."
The author writes: "No longer ago than when the
<i>Bedford Coffee house</i> was in Vogue, and Mr. <i>Cibber</i>
was writing <i>An Apology for his own Life</i>, there was
one Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; (the Importer of an expensive <i>Haymarket</i>
Comedy) an old Acquaintance of Mr. <i>Cibber</i>,
who, as well as he, retain'd a Smack of his antient
Taste. In those Days there was also a fair smirking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Damsel, whose name was <i>Susannah-Maria</i> * * *,
who happen'd to have Charms sufficient to revive
the decay'd Vigour of these two Friends. They
equally pursued her, even to the <i>Hazard of their
Health</i>, and were frequently seen dangling after her,
with tottering Knees, at one and the same Time.
You have heard, Sir, what a witty Friend of your
own said once on this Occasion: <i>Lo! yonder goes</i>
Susannah <i>and the two Elders.</i>" Even Genest has
applied this anecdote to Mrs. Woffington, but the
only circumstance that lends confirmation to this view
is the fact that Swiney (who is Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;) left her his
estate. Against this must be set the important points
that Susannah Maria was not Mrs. Woffington's name,
and that the joke depended for its neatness and applicability
on the name Susannah. The narrator of
the story, also, gives no hint that the damsel was the
famous actress, as he certainly would have done;
and, most important of all, it must be pointed out
that at the period mentioned, that is, while Cibber
was writing his "Apology," Mrs. Woffington had not
appeared in London. The "Apology" was published
in April, 1740, and had probably been completed in
the preceding November; while Mrs. Woffington
made her London <i>d√©b√ªt</i> on 6th November, 1740.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>During the season 1741-2, "At the particular
desire of several persons of Quality," Cibber made a
few appearances at Covent Garden; the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
being, in all probability, to oppose the extraordinary
attraction of Garrick at Goodman's Fields. In 1743-4
he played at the same theatre as Garrick, being
engaged at Drury Lane for a round of his famous
characters; but there is no record that Garrick and
he appeared in the same play. For the new actor
Cibber had, naturally enough, no great admiration.
He must have resented deeply the alteration in the
method of acting tragedy which Garrick introduced,
and is always reported as having lost no opportunity
of expressing his low opinion of the new school.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>His last appearances on the stage were in direct
rivalry with his young opponent. As has been
related, Cibber's alteration of "King John," which
had been "burked" in 1736-7, was produced, from
patriotic motives, in 1745. As the principal purpose
of the alteration was to make King John resent the
insolence of the Pope's Nuncio in a much more
emphatic manner than he does in Shakespeare, it
may easily be imagined how wretched a production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Cibber's play is. Genest's criticism is not too strong
when he says (iv. 161): "In a word, Cibber has on
this occasion shown himself utterly void of taste,
judgment and modesty&mdash;well might Fielding call
him Ground-Ivy, and say that no man was better
calculated to alter Shakspeare for the worse ... in
the Epilogue (which was spoken by Mrs. Clive)
Cibber speaks of himself with modesty, but in the
dedication, being emboldened by the favourable reception
of his Tragedy, he has the insolence to say
'<i>I have endeavoured to make it more like a play than
I found it in Shakspeare.</i>'" "Papal Tyranny" was
produced at Covent Garden on 15th February, 1745,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
and, in opposition to it, Shakespeare's play was put
up at Drury Lane, with Garrick as King John,
Macklin as Pandulph, and Mrs. Cibber (the great
Mrs. Cibber, wife of Theophilus) as Constance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Cibber's play was, nevertheless, successful; the profit
resulting to the author being, according to Victor,
four hundred pounds, which he wisely laid out in a
profitable annuity with Lord Mountford. In this
play Cibber made his last appearance on the stage,
on 26th February, 1745, on which day "Papal
Tyranny" was played for the tenth time. "After
which," says Victor ("History," ii. 49) "he retired
to his easy Chair and his Chariot, to waste the Remains
of Life with a chearful, contented Mind, without
the least bodily Complaint, but that of a slow,
unavoidable Decay."</p>

<p>His state of mind was probably the more "chearful
and contented" because of his unquestionable success
in his tilt with the formidable author of "The Dunciad;"
a success none the less certain at the time, that the
enduring fame of Pope has caused Cibber's triumph
over him to be lost sight of now. The progress of
the quarrel between these enemies has already been
related up to the publication of Cibber's "Apology"
(see vol. i. p. 36), and on pages 21, 35, and 36 of the
first volume of this edition will be found Cibber's
perfectly good-natured and proper remarks on Pope's
attacks on him. Whether the very fact that Cibber
did not show temper irritated his opponent, I do not
know; but it probably did so, for in the fourth book
of "The Dunciad," published in 1742, Pope had
another fling at his opponent (line 17):&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"She mounts the throne: her head a cloud conceal'd,</div>
<div class="i0">In broad effulgence all below reveal'd;</div>
<div class="i0">('Tis thus aspiring Dulness ever shines:)</div>
<div class="i0">Soft on her lap her laureate son reclines."</div>
</div></div>

<p>And in line 532 he talks of "Cibberian forehead"
as typical of unblushing impudence.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that this last attack exhausted
Cibber's patience. He had hitherto received his
punishment with good temper and good humour;
but his powerful enemy had not therefore held his
hand. He now determined to retaliate. Conscious
of the diseased susceptibility of Pope to ridicule, he
felt himself quite capable of replying, not with equal
literary power, but with much superior practical effect.
Accordingly in 1742 there appeared a pamphlet
entitled "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope,
inquiring into the motives that might induce him in
his Satyrical Works, to be so frequently fond of Mr.
Cibber's name." To it was prefixed the motto:
"<i>Out of thy own Mouth will I judge thee.</i> Pref. to
the <i>Dunciad</i>."</p>

<p>Cibber commences by stating that he had been
persuaded to reply to Pope by his friends; who
insisted that for him to treat his attacker any longer
with silent disdain might be thought a confession of
Dulness indeed. This is a highly probable statement;
for an encounter between the vivacious Cibber
and the thin-skinned Pope promised a wealth of
amusement for those who looked on&mdash;a promise
which was amply fulfilled. Cibber proceeds to assure
Pope that, having entered the lists, he will not in
future avoid the fray, but reply to every atta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>ck made
on him.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> He confesses his vast inferiority to Pope,
but adds: "I own myself so contented a Dunce, that
I would not have even your merited Fame in Poetry,
if it were to be attended with half the fretful Solicitude
you seem to have lain under to maintain it; of
which the laborious Rout you make about it, in those
Loads of Prose Rubbish, wherewith you have almost
smother'd your <i>Dunciad</i>, is so sore a Proof." On
page 17 of his "Letter" Cibber gives an interesting
account of a quarrel between Pope and himself, to
which he, with sufficient probability, attributes much
of Pope's enmity. The passage is curious and important,
so I quote it in full:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Play of the <i>Rehearsal</i>, which had lain some
few Years dormant, being by his present Majesty
(then Prince of <i>Wales</i>) commanded to be revived,
the Part of <i>Bays</i> fell to my share. To this Character
there had always been allow'd such ludicrous
Liberties of Observation, upon any thing new, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
remarkable, in the state of the Stage, as Mr. <i>Bays</i>
might think proper to take. Much about this time,
then, <i>The Three Hours after Marriage</i> had been
acted without Success;<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> when Mr. <i>Bays</i>, as usual,
had a fling at it, which, in itself, was no Jest, unless
the Audience would please to make it one: But
however, flat as it was, Mr. <i>Pope</i> was mortally sore
upon it. This was the Offence. In this Play, two
Coxcombs, being in love with a learned Virtuoso's
Wife, to get unsuspected Access to her, ingeniously
send themselves, as two presented Rarities, to the
Husband, the one curiously swath'd up like an <i>Egyptian</i>
Mummy, and the other slily cover'd in the Pasteboard
Skin of a Crocodile: upon which poetical
Expedient, I, Mr. <i>Bays</i>, when the two Kings of
<i>Brentford</i> came from the Clouds into the Throne
again, instead of what my Part directed me to say,
made use of these Words, viz. 'Now, Sir, this Revolution,
I had some Thoughts of introducing, by a quite
different Contrivance; but my Design taking air, some
of your sharp Wits, I found, had made use of it before
me; otherwise I intended to have stolen one of them
in, in the Shape of a <i>Mummy</i>, and t'other, in that of
a <i>Crocodile</i>.' Upon which, I doubt, the Audience by
the Roar of their Applause shew'd their proportionable
Contempt of the Play they belong'd to. But
why am I answerable for that? I did not lead them,
by any Reflection of my own, into that Contempt:
Surely to have used the bare Word <i>Mummy</i>, and
<i>Crocodile</i>, was neither unjust, or unmannerly; Where
then was the Crime of simply saying there had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
two such things in a former Play? But this, it seems,
was so heinously taken by Mr. <i>Pope</i>, that, in the
swelling of his Heart, after the Play was over, he
came behind the Scenes, with his Lips pale and his
Voice trembling, to call me to account for the Insult:
And accordingly fell upon me with all the foul Language,
that a Wit out of his Senses could be capable
of&mdash;&mdash;How durst I have the Impudence to treat any
Gentleman in that manner? <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i> Now let
the Reader judge by this Concern, who was the true
Mother of the Child! When he was almost choked
with the foam of his Passion, I was enough recover'd
from my Amazement to make him (as near as I can
remember) this Reply, <i>viz.</i> 'Mr. <i>Pope</i>&mdash;&mdash;You are
so particular a Man, that I must be asham'd to return
your Language as I ought to do: but since you have
attacked me in so monstrous a Manner; This you
may depend upon, that so long as the Play continues
to be acted, I will never fail to repeat the same
Words over and over again.' Now, as he accordingly
found I kept my Word, for several Days following,
I am afraid he has since thought, that his
Pen was a sharper Weapon than his Tongue to trust
his Revenge with. And however just Cause this
may be for his so doing, it is, at least, the only Cause
my Conscience can charge me with. Now, as I might
have concealed this Fact if my Conscience would
have suffered me, may we not suppose, Mr. <i>Pope</i>
would certainly have mention'd it in his <i>Dunciad</i>,
had he thought it could have been of service to h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>im?"</p>

<p>Cibber afterwards proceeds to criticise and reply
to allusions to himself in Pope's works, some of
which are in conspicuously bad taste. Cibber, of
course, does not miss the obvious point that to attack
his successful plays was a foolish proceeding on
Pope's part, whose own endeavours as a dramatist
had been completely unsuccessful, and who thus laid
himself open to the charge of envy. Nor is this
accusation so ridiculous as it may seem to readers of
to-day, for a successful playwright was a notable
public figure, and the delicious applause of the
crowded theatre was eagerly sought by even the
most eminent men. And again, it must be remembered
that Pope's fame was not then the perfectly
assured matter that it is now.</p>

<p>But Cibber's great point, which made his opponent
writhe with fury, was a little anecdote&mdash;Dr.
Johnson terms it "an idle story of Pope's behaviour
at a tavern"&mdash;which raised a universal shout of
merriment at Pope's expense. The excuse for its
introduction was found in these lines from the
"Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Whom have I hurt? has poet yet or peer</div>
<div class="i0">Lost the arch'd eyebrow or Parnassian sneer?</div>
<div class="i0">And has not Colley still his lord and whore?</div>
<div class="i0">His butchers Henley? his freemasons Moore?"</div>
</div></div>

<p>Cibber's anecdote cannot be defended on the
ground of decency, but it is extremely ludicrous, and
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span> the state of society then existing it must have
been a knock-down blow to the unhappy subject of
it. There can be little doubt that it was this
pamphlet which Pope received on the occasion when
the Richardsons visited him, as related by Johnson
in his Life of the poet: "I have heard Mr. Richardson
relate that he attended his father the painter on
a visit, when one of Cibber's pamphlets came into the
hands of Pope, who said, 'These things are my
diversion.' They sat by him while he perused it,
and saw his features writhing with anguish: and
young Richardson said to his father, when they
returned, that he hoped to be preserved from such
diversion as had been that day the lot of Pope."
How deeply Pope was galled by Cibber's ludicrous
picture of him is manifested by the extraordinary
revenge he took. And even now we can realize the
bitterness of the provocation when we read the maliciously
comic story of the vivacious Colley:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to the first Part of the Charge, the <i>Lord</i>;
Why&mdash;we have both had him, and sometimes the
<i>same</i> Lord; but as there is neither Vice nor Folly in
keeping our Betters Company; the Wit or Satyr of
the Verse! can only point at my Lord for keeping
such <i>ordinary</i> Company. Well, but if so! then <i>why</i>
so, good Mr. <i>Pope</i>? If either of us could be <i>good</i>
Company, our being professed Poets, I hope would
be no Objection to my Lord's sometimes making
one with us? and though I don't pretend to write
like you, yet all the Requisites to make a good Companion
are not confined to Poetry! No, Sir, even a
Man's inoffensive Follies and Blunders may so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>metimes
have their Merits at the best Table; and in
those, I am sure, you won't pretend to vie with me:
Why then may not my Lord be as much in the Right,
in his sometimes choosing <i>Colley</i> to laugh at, as at
other times in his picking up <i>Sawney</i>, whom he can
only admire?</p>

<p>"Thus far, then, I hope we are upon a par; for
the Lord, you see, will fit either of us.</p>

<p>"As to the latter Charge, the <i>Whore</i>, there indeed,
I doubt you will have the better of me; for I must own,
that I believe I know more of <i>your</i> whoring than you
do of <i>mine</i>; because I don't recollect that ever I made
you the least Confidence of <i>my</i> Amours, though I
have been very near an Eye-Witness of <i>Yours</i>&mdash;&mdash;By
the way, gentle Reader, don't you think, to say
only, <i>a Man has his Whore</i>, without some particular
Circumstances to aggravate the Vice, is the flattest
Piece of Satyr that ever fell from the formidable Pen
of Mr. <i>Pope</i>? because (<i>defendit numerus</i>) take the
first ten thousand Men you meet, and I believe, you
would be no Loser, if you betted ten to one that
every single Sinner of them, one with another, had
been guilty of the same Frailty. But as Mr. <i>Pope</i>
has so particularly picked me out of the Number to
make an Example of: Why may I not take the
same Liberty, and even single him out for another
to keep me in Countenance? He must excuse me,
then, if in what I am going to relate, I am reduced
to make bold with a little private Conversation: But
as he has shewn no Mercy to <i>Colley</i>, why sh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>ould so
unprovok'd an Aggressor expect any for himself?
And if Truth hurts him, I can't help it. He may
remember, then (or if he won't I will) when <i>Button</i>'s
Coffee-house was in vogue, and so long ago, as when
he had not translated above two or three Books of
<i>Homer</i>; there was a late young Nobleman (as much
his <i>Lord</i> as mine) who had a good deal of wicked
Humour, and who, though he was fond of having
Wits in his Company, was not so restrained by his
Conscience, but that he lov'd to laugh at any merry
Mischief he could do them: This noble Wag, I say,
in his usual <i>Gayet√® de C&oelig;ur</i>, with another Gentleman
still in Being,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> one Evening slily seduced the
celebrated Mr. <i>Pope</i> as a Wit, and myself as a
Laugher, to a certain House of Carnal Recreation,
near the <i>Hay-Market</i>; where his Lordship's Frolick
propos'd was to slip his little <i>Homer</i>, as he call'd
him, at a Girl of the Game, that he might see what
sort of Figure a Man of his Size, Sobriety, and
Vigour (in Verse) would make, when the frail Fit of
Love had got into him; in which he so far succeeded,
that the smirking Damsel, who serv'd us with Tea,
happen'd to have Charms sufficient to tempt the
little-tiny Manhood of Mr. <i>Pope</i> into the next Room
with her: at which you may imagine, his Lordship
was in as much Joy, at what might happen within, as
our small Friend could probably be in Possessio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>n of
it: But I (forgive me all ye mortified Mortals whom
his fell Satyr has since fallen upon) observing he had
staid as long as without hazard of his Health he
might, I,</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">
<i>Prick'd to it by foolish Honesty and Love,</i>
</p>

<p>As <i>Shakespear</i> says, without Ceremony, threw open
the Door upon him, where I found this little hasty
Hero, like a terrible <i>Tom Tit</i>, pertly perching upon
the Mount of Love! But such was my Surprize,
that I fairly laid hold of his Heels, and actually drew
him down safe and sound from his Danger. My
Lord, who staid tittering without, in hopes the sweet
Mischief he came for would have been compleated,
upon my giving an Account of the Action within,
began to curse, and call me an hundred silly Puppies,
for my impertinently spoiling the Sport; to which
with great Gravity I reply'd; pray, my Lord, consider
what I have done was, in regard to the Honour of our
Nation! For would you have had so glorious a
Work as that of making <i>Homer</i> speak elegant
<i>English</i>, cut short by laying up our little Gentleman
of a Malady, which his thin Body might never have
been cured of? No, my Lord! <i>Homer</i> would have
been too serious a Sacrifice to our Evening Merriment.
Now as his <i>Homer</i> has since been so happily
compleated, who can say, that the World may not
have been obliged to the kindly Care of <i>Colley</i> that
so great a Work ever came to Perfection?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>
<p>"And now again, gentle Reader, let it be judged,
whether the <i>Lord</i> and the <i>Whore</i> above-mentioned
might not, with equal Justice, have been apply'd to
sober <i>Sawney</i> the Satyrist, as to <i>Colley</i> the Criminal?</p>

<p>"Though I confess Recrimination to be but a poor
Defence for one's own Faults; yet when the Guilty
are Accusers, it seems but just, to make use of any
Truth, that may invalidate their Evidence: I therefore
hope, whatever the serious Reader may think
amiss in this Story, will be excused, by my being so
hardly driven to tell it."</p>

<p>In the remainder of Cibber's pamphlet there is not
much that is of any importance, though an allusion
to one of Pope's victims having hung up a birch in
Button's Coffee House, wherewith to chastise his
satirist, was skilfully calculated to rouse Pope's temper.
Cibber thoroughly succeeded in this object,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
perhaps to a degree that he rather regretted. Pope
made no direct reply to his banter, but in the following
year (1743) a new edition of "The Dunciad"
appeared, in which Theobald was deposed from the
throne of Dulness, and Cibber elevated in his place.
By doing this Pope gratified his vengeance, but
injured his poem, for the carefully painted peculiarities
of Theobald, a slow and pedantic scholar, sat ill on
the pert and vivacious Colley.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> To this retaliat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>ion
Cibber, as he had promised,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> replied with another
pamphlet, entitled "Another Occasional Letter from
Mr. Cibber to Mr. Pope. Wherein the New Hero's
Preferment to his Throne, in the <i>Dunciad</i>, seems
not to be Accepted. And the Author of that Poem
His more rightful Claim to it, is Asserted. With
An Expostulatory Address to the Reverend Mr.
<i>W. W&mdash;&mdash;n</i>, Author of the new Preface, and Adviser
in the curious Improvements of that Satire."
The motto on the title-page was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;<i>Remember</i> Sauney's <i>Fate!</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Bang'd by the Blockhead, whom he strove to beat.</i></div>
<div class="i3">Parodie on Lord <i>Roscommon</i>."</div>
</div></div>

<p>There is little that is of any note in this production,
which is characterized by the same real or affected
good-nature as marked the former pamphlet. The
most interesting passages to us are those alluding to
the effect of Cibber's previous attack, and exulting
over Pope's distress at it. For instance (on page
7):&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now, Sir, give me leave to be a little surpriz'd
at the impenetrable Skull of your Courage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
that (after I had in my first Letter) so heartily teiz'd,
and toss'd, and tumbled you through all the Mire,
and Dirt, the madness of your Muse had been
throwing at other People, it could still, so Vixen like,
sprawl out the same feeble Paw of its Satyr, to have
t'other Scratch at my Nose: But as I know the
Vulgar (with whose Applause I humbly content my
self) are apt to laugh when they see a curst Cat in a
Kennel; so whenever I observe your <i>Grimalkin</i>
Spirit shew but the least grinning Gasp of Life, I
shall take the honest liberty of old <i>Towser</i> the
House-dog, and merrily lift up my Leg to have a
little more Game with you.</p>

<p>"Well Sir, in plainer Terms, I am now, you see,
once more willing to bring Matters to an Issue, or
(as the Boxers say) to answer your Challenge, and
come to a Trial of Manhood with you; though by
our slow Proceedings, we seem rather to be at <i>Law</i>,
than at <i>Loggerheads</i> with one another; and if you
had not been a blinder Booby, than my self, you
would have sate down quietly, with the last black
Eye I gave you: For so loath was I to squabble
with you, that though you had been snapping, and
snarling at me for twenty Years together, you saw,
I never so much as gave you a single Growl, or took
any notice of you. At last, 'tis true, in meer Sport
for others, rather than from the least Tincture of
Concern for my self, I was inticed to be a little wanton,
not to say waggish, with your Character; by which
having (you know) got the strong Laugh on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Side, I doubt I have so offended the Gravity, and
Greatness of your Soul, that to secure your more
ample Revenge, you have prudently taken the full
Term of thirteen Months Consideration, before you
would pour it, upon me! But at last, it seems, we
have it, and now Souse! out comes your old <i>Dunciad</i>,
in a new Dress, like fresh Gold, upon stale Gingerbread,
sold out in Penny-worth's of shining King
<i>Colley</i>, crown'd the Hero of Immortal Stupidity!"</p>

<p>And again (on page 15): "At your Peril be it,
little Gentleman, for I shall have t'other Frisk with
you, and don't despair that the very Notice I am
now taking of you, will once more make your Fame
fly, like a yelping Cur with a Bottle at his Tail, the
Jest and Joy of every Bookseller's Prentice between
<i>Wapping</i> and <i>Westminster</i>!"</p>

<p>To this pamphlet Pope, whose infirmities were
very great, made no reply, and Cibber had, as he
had vowed, the last word. Round the central
articles of this quarrel a crowd of supplementary
productions had gathered, a list of which will be
found in the Bibliography of Cibber a few pages
on.</p>

<p>Cibber's position of Poet Laureate furnished him
with a steady income during his declining years, and
his Odes were turned out as required, with mechanical
precision and most unpoetic spirit. They were the
standing joke of the pamphleteers and news-sheet
writers, and were always accompanied with a running
fire of banter and parody. Those curious in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
matter will find excellent specimens, both of the
Odes and the burlesques, in the early volumes of
the "Gentleman's Magazine."</p>

<p>After the termination of his quarrel with Pope,
Cibber's life was very uneventful; and, although it
extended far beyond the allotted span, he continued
to enjoy it to the very end. Horace Walpole greeted
him one day, saying, "I am glad, Sir, to see you
looking so well." "Egad, Sir," replied the old man,
"at eighty-four it is well for a man that he can look
at all." On 11th December, 1757, he died, having
attained the great age of eighty-six.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Dr. Doran
"Their Majesties' Servants," 1888 edition, ii. 235)
says: "I read in contemporary publications that
there 'died at his house in Berkeley Square, Colley
Cibber, Esq., Poet Laureate;'" and although it has
been stated that he died at Islington, I see no reason
to doubt Dr. Doran's explicit statement. Cibber
was buried in the Danish Church, Wellclose Square.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>
<p>So far as we know, only two of Cibber's children
survived him, his ne'er-do-well son Theophilus, and
his equally scapegrace daughter Charlotte, who
married Charke the musician. The former was born
in 1703, and was drowned in the winter of 1758,
while crossing to Ireland to fulfil an engagement in
Dublin. As an actor he was chiefly famous for
playing Ancient Pistol, but he was also excellent in
some of his father's characters, such as Lord Foppington,
Bayes, and Sir Francis Wronghead. His
private life was in the last degree disreputable, and
especially so in his relations with his second wife,
Susanna Maria Arne&mdash;the great Mrs. Cibber. The
literature regarding Theophilus Cibber is considerable
in quantity and curious in quality. Some
account of it will be found in my "Bibliographical
Account of English Theatrical Literature," pp. 52-55.
Charlotte Charke, who was born about 1710, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
died in April, 1760, was of no note as an actress.
Her private life, however, was madly eccentric, and
her autobiography, published in 1755, is a curious
and scarce work.</p>

<p>Cibber's principal plays have been noted in the
course of his "Apology;" but, for the sake of convenience,
I give here a complete list of his regular
dramatic productions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Damon and Phillida&mdash;Pastoral Farce&mdash;Haymarket,

<p>Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John&mdash;Tragedy
(alteration of Shakespeare's "King John")&mdash;Covent
Garden, 15th February, 1745.</p>

<p>Of these, his alteration of "Richard III." had practically
undisputed possession of the stage, until the
taste and judgment of Mr. Henry Irving gave us
back the original play.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> But in the provinces, when
stars of the old school play a round of legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
parts, the adulterated version still reigns triumphant,
and the great effect of the night is got in Cibber's
famous line:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">
"Off with his head! So much for Buckingham!"
</p>

<p>In "The Hypocrite," a comedy still played at
intervals, Cibber's "Nonjuror" survives. Bickerstaffe,
who was the author of the alteration, retained
a very large portion of the original play, his chief
change being the addition of the inimitable Mawworm.</p>

<p>That another of Cibber's plays survives is owing
to the taste of an American manager and to the
genius of an American company of comedians. Mr.
Augustin Daly's company includes among its repertory
Cibber's comedy of "She Would and She Would
Not," and has shown in London as well as in New
York how admirable a comedy it is. It goes without
saying to those who have seen this company, that
much of the success was due to Miss Ada Rehan, who
showed in Hypolita, as she has done in Katharine
("Taming of the Shrew"), that she is mistress of
classical comedy as of modern touch-and-go farce.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Cibber was the cause of quite a considerable literature,
mostly abusive. The following list, taken from
my "Bibliographical Account of English Theatrical
Literature" (1888), is, I believe, a complete catalogue
of all separate publications by, or relating to, Colley
Cibber:&mdash;</p>

<p>A clue to the comedy of the Non-Juror. With
some hints of consequence relating to that play. In
a letter to N. Rowe, Esq; Poet Laureat to His
Majesty. London (Curll): 1718. 8vo. 6d.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cibber's "Non-Juror," produced at Drury-Lane, December 6,
1717, was written in favour of the Hanoverian succession. Rowe
wrote the prologue, which was very abusive of Nonjurors. This
tract is not an attack on the play, but a satire on, it is said,
Bishop Hoadly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lash for the Laureat: or an address by way of
Satyr; most humbly inscrib'd to the unparallel'd
Mr. Rowe, on occasion of a late insolent Prologu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>e
to the Non-Juror. London (J. Morphew): 1718.
folio. Title, 1 leaf: Pref. 1 leaf. pp. 8. 6d.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A furious attack on Rowe on account of his Prologue. A tract
of extreme rarity.</p></blockquote>

<p>A compleat key to the Non-Juror. Explaining
the characters in that play, with observations thereon.
By Mr. Joseph Gay. The second edioion (<i>sic</i>).
London (Curll): 1718. 8vo. pp. 24 including title
and half-title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3rd edition: 1718. Joseph Gay is a pseudonym. Pope is said to
be the author of the pamphlet, which is very unfriendly to Cibber.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Theatre-Royal turn'd into a mountebank's
stage. In some remarks upon Mr. Cibber's quack-dramatical
performance, called the Non-Juror. By a
Non-Juror. London (Morphew): 1718. 8vo. Title
1 leaf. pp. 38. 6d.</p>

<p>The Comedy call'd the Non-Juror. Shewing the
particular scenes wherein that hypocrite is concern'd.
With remarks, and a key, explaining the characters
of that excellent play. London (printed for J. L.):
1718. 8vo. pp. 24, including title. 2d.</p>

<p>Some cursory remarks on the play call'd the Non-Juror,
written by Mr. Cibber. In a letter to a friend.
London (Chetwood): 1718. 8vo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dated from Button's Coffee-House and signed "H. S." Very
laudatory.</p></blockquote>

<p>A journey to London. Being part of a comedy
written by the late Sir John Vanbrugh, Knt. and
printed after his own copy: which (since his de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>cease)
has been made an intire play, by Mr. Cibber, and
call'd The provok'd husband, &amp;c. London (Watts):
1728. 8vo. pp. 51, including title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Provok'd Husband," by Vanbrugh and Cibber, was produced
at Drury Lane, January 10, 1728; and though Cibber's
Nonjuror enemies tried to condemn it, was very successful. This
tract shows how much of the play was written by Vanbrugh.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reflections on the principal characters in the Provoked
Husband. London: 1728. 8vo.</p>

<p>An apology for the life of Mr. Colley Cibber,
comedian, and late patentee of the Theatre-Royal.
With an historical view of the stage during his own
time. Written by himself. London (Printed by
John Watts for the author): 1740. 4to. Port.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second edition, London, 1740, 8vo., no portrait; third edition,
London, 1750, 8vo., portrait; fourth edition, 1756, 2 vols. 12mo.,
portrait. A good edition was published, London, 1822, 8vo.,
with notes by E. Bellchambers and a portrait. The "Apology"
forms one of Hunt's series of autobiographies, London, 1826.
One of the most famous and valuable of theatrical books.</p></blockquote>

comedian. Being a proper sequel to the Apology
for the life of Mr. Colley Cibber, comedian. With
an historical view of the stage to the present year.
Supposed to be written by himself. In the stile and
manner of the Poet Laureat. London (Mechell):
1740. 8vo. 2s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The object of this pamphlet, ascribed to Fielding, is chiefly to
ridicule Colley Cibber's "Apology." Herman, 22s.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>
<p>A brief supplement to Colley Cibber, Esq; his
lives of the late famous Actors and Actresses. <i>Si tu
scis, melior ego.</i> By Anthony, Vulg√≤ Tony Aston.
Printed for the Author, <span class="smcap">N.P.</span> (London): <span class="smcap">N.D.</span> (1747-8).
8vo. pp. 24 including title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A pamphlet of extreme rarity. Isaac Reed purchased a copy
in 1769; and in 1795 he notes on it that, though he has had it
twenty-six years, he has never seen another copy. Reed's copy
was bought by Field for 65s., at whose sale, in 1827, Genest
bought it for 36s.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tryal of Colley Cibber, comedian, &amp;c. for
writing a book intitled An apology for his life, &amp;c.
Being a thorough examination thereof; wherein he
is proved guilty of High Crimes and Misdemeanors
against the English language, and in characterising
many persons of distinction.... Together with an
indictment exhibited against Alexander Pope of

this juncture: and the arraignment of George Cheyne,

and Theological heresies, uttered in his last book
on Regimen. London (for the author): 1740. 8vo.

Esq; containing explanations, amendments, and observations,
on a book intituled, An apology for the
life, and writings of Mr. Colley Cibber. Not written
by himself. With some anecdotes of the Laureat,
which he (thro' an excess of modesty) omitted. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>To

<blockquote>
<p>Second edition, London, 1744, 8vo.; reprinted, London, 1777,

title. 1s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anonymous, but undoubtedly by Cibber himself.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another occasional letter from Mr. Cibber to Mr.
Pope. Wherein the new hero's preferment to his

to it, is asserted. With an expostulatory address t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>o
the Reverend Mr. W. W&mdash;&mdash;n, author of the new
preface, and adviser in the curious improvements of
that satire. By Mr. Colley Cibber. London (Lewis):
1744. 8vo. 1s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rev. W. W&mdash;&mdash;n is Warburton. This tract was reprinted,
Glasgow, n. d., 8vo. The two "Letters" were reprinted, London,
1777, with, I believe, a curious frontispiece representing the adventure
related by Cibber at Pope's expense in the first "Letter."
I am not certain whether the frontispiece was issued with the
London or Glasgow reprint, having seen it in copies of both. In
Bonn's "Lowndes" (1865) is mentioned a parody on this first
"Letter," with the same title, except that "Mrs. Cibber's name"
is substituted for "Mr. Cibber's name." Lowndes says: "A copy
is described in Mr. Thorpe's catalogue, p. iv, 1832, 'with the
frontispiece of Pope surprized with Mrs. Cibber.'" I gravely
doubt the existence of any such work, and fancy that this frontispiece
is the one just mentioned, but wrongly described. Herman
(two Letters, with scarce front.), 40s.</p></blockquote>

<p>A letter to Colley Cibber, Esq; on his transformation
of King John. London. 1745. 8vo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cibber's mangling of "King John," entitled "Papal Tyranny
in the Reign of King John," was produced at Covent Garden,
February 15, 1745.</p></blockquote>

<p>A new book of the Dunciad: occasion'd by Mr.
Warburton's new edition of the Dunciad complete.
By a gentleman of one of the Inns of Court. With
several of Mr. Warburton's own notes, and likewise
Notes <i>Variorum</i>. London (J. Payne &amp; J. Bouquet):
1750. 4to. 1s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cibber dethroned and Warburton elevated to the throne of
Dulness.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>
<p>Shakspere's tragedy of Richard III., considered
dramatically and historically; and in comparison
with Cibber's alteration as at present in use on the
stage, in a lecture delivered to the members of the
Liverpool Literary, Scientific and Commercial Institution,
by Thos. Stuart, of the Theatre Royal.
(Liverpool): n. d. (about 1850). 12mo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cibber published in 1747 a work entitled "The
Character and Conduct of Cicero, considered from
the history of his life by Dr. Middleton;" but it is
of little value or interest.</p>

To COLLEY CIBBER, Esq; <span class="smcap">his</span><br />
LIVES<br />
<span class="smcap">of the late famous</span><br />
<span class="smcap">ACTORS and ACTRESSES.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. <i>Betterton</i> (although a superlative
good Actor) labour'd under ill Figure, being
clumsily made, having a great Head, a short thick
Neck, stoop'd in the Shoulders, and had fat short
Arms, which he rarely lifted higher than his Stomach.&mdash;His
Left Hand frequently lodg'd in his Breast,
between his Coat and Waist-coat, while, wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>th his
Right, he prepar'd his Speech.&mdash;His Actions were
few, but just.&mdash;He had little Eyes, and a broad Face,
a little Pock-fretten, a corpulent Body, and thick
Legs, with large Feet.&mdash;He was better to meet, than
to follow; for his Aspect was serious, venerable, and
majestic; in his latter Time a little paralytic.&mdash;His
Voice was low and grumbling; yet he could Tune it
by an artful <i>Climax</i>, which enforc'd universal Attention,
even from the <i>Fops</i> and <i>Orange-Girls</i>.&mdash;He was
incapable of dancing, even in a Country-Dance; as
was Mrs. <i>BARRY</i>: But their good Qualities were
more than equal to their Deficiencies.&mdash;While Mrs.
<i>BRACEGIRDLE</i> sung very agreeably in the
LOVES of <i>Mars</i> and <i>Venus</i>, and danced in a
Country-Dance, as well as Mr. <i>WILKS</i>, though not
with so much Art and Foppery, but like a well-bred
Gentlewoman.&mdash;Mr. <i>Betterton</i> was the most extensive
Actor, from <i>Alexander</i> to Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>;
but, in <i>that</i> last Character, he wanted the Waggery
of <i>ESTCOURT</i>, the Drollery of <i>HARPER</i>, the
Sallaciousness of <i>JACK EVANS</i>.&mdash;But, then, <i>Estcourt</i>
was too trifling; <i>Harper</i> had too much of
the <i>Bartholomew-Fair</i>; and <i>Evans</i> misplac'd his
Humour.&mdash;Thus, you see what <i>Flaws</i> are in <i>bright
Diamonds</i>:&mdash;And I have often wish'd that Mr.
<i>Betterton</i> would have resign'd the Part of HAMLET
to some young Actor, (who might have Personated,
though not have Acted, it better) for, when he threw
himself at <i>Ophelia's</i> Feet, he appear'd a little too
grave for a young Student, lately come from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
University of <i>Wirtemberg</i>; and his <i>Repartees</i> seem'd
rather as <i>Apopthegms</i> from a <i>sage Philosopher</i>, than
the <i>sporting Flashes</i> of a Young <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>; and no
one else could have pleas'd the Town, he was so
rooted in their Opinion.&mdash;His younger Cotemporary,
(<i>Betterton</i> 63, <i>Powel</i> 40, Years old) <i>POWEL</i>,
attempted several of <i>Betterton's</i> Parts, as <i>Alexander</i>,
<i>Jaffier</i>, &amp;c. but lost his Credit; as, in <i>Alexander</i>,
he maintain'd not the Dignity of a King, but
<i>Out-Heroded</i> <span class="smcap">Herod</span>; and in his poison'd, mad Scene,
<i>out-rav'd all Probability</i>; while <i>Betterton</i> kept his
Passion under, and shew'd it most (as Fume smoaks
most, when stifled). <i>Betterton</i>, from the Time he was
dress'd, to the End of the Play, kept his Mind in the
same Temperament and Adaptness, as the present
Character required.&mdash;If I was to write of him all Day,
I should still remember fresh Matter in his Behalf;
and, before I part with him, suffer this facetious
Story of him, and a Country Tenant of his.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Betterton</i> had a small Farm near <i>Reading</i>, in
the County of <i>Berks</i>; and the Countryman came, in
the Time of <i>Bartholomew-Fair</i>, to pay his Rent.&mdash;Mr.
<i>Betterton</i> took him to the Fair, and going to one
<i>Crawley's</i> Puppet-Shew, offer'd <i>Two Shillings</i> for
himself and <i>Roger</i>, his Tenant.&mdash;<i>No, no, Sir</i>, said
<i>Crawley</i>; <i>we never take Money of one another</i>.
This affronted Mr. <i>Betterton</i> who threw down the
Money, and they enter'd.&mdash;<i>Roger</i> was hugeously
diverted with <i>Punch</i>, and bred a great Noise, saying,
that he would drink with him, for he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
merry Fellow.&mdash;Mr. <i>Betterton</i> told him, he was only
a Puppet, made up of <i>Sticks and Rags</i>: However,
<i>Roger</i> still cried out, that he would go and drink with
<i>Punch</i>.&mdash;When Master took him behind, where the
Puppets hung up, he swore, he thought <i>Punch</i> had
been alive.&mdash;<i>However</i>, said he, <i>though he be but</i> Sticks
and Rags, <i>I'll give him Six-pence to drink my Health</i>.&mdash;At
Night, Mr. <i>Betterton</i> went to the <i>Theatre</i>, when
was play'd the ORPHAN; Mr. <i>Betterton</i> acting <i>Castalio</i>;
Mrs. <i>Barry</i>, <i>Monimia</i>.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Well</i> (said Master)
<i>how dost like this Play</i>, Roger? <i>Why, I don't knows</i>,
(says <i>Roger</i>) <i>its well enought for</i> Sticks and Rags.</p>

<p>To end with this <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> of the Stage, I must say
of him, as <i>Hamlet</i> does of his Father: "He was
a Man (take him for all in all) I cannot look upon his
Like again."</p>

<p>His Favourite, Mrs. <i>BARRY</i>, claims the next in
√Üstimation. They were both never better pleas'd,
than in Playing together.&mdash;Mrs. <i>Barry</i> outshin'd
Mrs. <i>Bracegirdle</i> in the Character of ZARA in the
<i>Mourning Bride</i>, altho' Mr. <i>Congreve</i> design'd
Almeria for that Favour.&mdash;And yet, this fine Creature
was not handsome, her Mouth op'ning most on the
Right Side, which she strove to draw t'other Way, and,
at Times, composing her Face, as if sitting to have
her Picture drawn.&mdash;Mrs. <i>Barry</i> was middle-siz'd,
and had darkish Hair, light Eyes, dark Eye-brows,
and was indifferently plump:&mdash;Her Face somewhat
preceded her Action, as the latter did her Words,
her Face ever expressing the Passions; not like t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>he
Actresses of late Times, who are afraid of putting
their Faces out of the Form of Non-meaning, lest
they should crack the Cerum, White-Wash, or other
Cosmetic, trowel'd on. Mrs. <i>Barry</i> had a Manner
of drawing out her Words, which became her, but not
Mrs. <i>Braidshaw</i>, and Mrs. <i>Porter</i>, (Successors.)&mdash;&mdash;To
hear her speak the following Speech in the
<span class="smcap">Orphan</span>, was a Charm:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"><i>I'm ne'er so well pleas'd, as when I hear thee speak,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;"><i>And listen to the Music of thy Voice.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"><i>Who's he that speaks with a Voice so sweet,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;"><i>As the Shepherd pipes upon the Mountain,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;"><i>When all his little Flock are gath'ring round him?</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Neither she, nor any of the Actors of those Times,
had any Tone in their speaking, (too much, lately, in
Use.)&mdash;In <i>Tragedy</i> she was solemn and august&mdash;in
<i>Free Comedy</i> alert, easy, and genteel&mdash;pleasant in her
Face and Action; filling the Stage with Variety of
Gesture.&mdash;She was Woman to Lady <i>Shelton</i>, of
<i>Norfolk</i>, (my Godmother)&mdash;when Lord <i>Rochester</i>
took her on the Stage; where for some Time, they
could make nothing of her.&mdash;She could neither sing,
nor dance, no, not in a Country-Dance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. <i>BRACEGIRDLE</i>, that <i>Diana</i> of the Stage,
hath many Places contending for her Birth&mdash;The
most received Opinion is, that she was the Daughter
of a Coachman, Coachmaker, or Letter-out of Coaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>,
in the Town of <i>Northampton</i>.&mdash;But I am inclinable
to my Father's Opinion, (who had a great Value for
her reported Virtue) that she was a distant Relation,
and came out of <i>Staffordshire</i>, from about <i>Walsal</i> or
<i>Wolverhampton</i>.&mdash;She had many Assailants on her
Virtue, as Lord <i>Lovelace</i>, Mr. <i>Congreve</i>, the last of
which had her Company most; but she ever resisted
his vicious Attacks, and, yet, was always uneasy at
his leaving her; on which Observation he made the
following Song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">PIOUS Celinda <i>goes to Pray'rs,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Whene'er I ask the Favour;</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Yet, the tender Fool's in Tears,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>When she believes I'll leave her.</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Wou'd I were free from this Restraint,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Or else had Power to win her!</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Wou'd she cou'd make of me a Saint,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Or I of her a Sinner!</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>And, as Mr. <i>Durfey</i> alludes to it in his Puppet
Song&mdash;in <i>Don Quixot</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Since that our Fate intends</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Our Amity shall be no dearer,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Still let us kiss and be Friends,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>And sigh we shall never come nearer.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>She was very shy of Lord <i>Lovelace's</i> Company, as
being an engaging Man, who drest well: And as,
every Day, his Servant came to her, to ask her how
she did, she always return'd her Answer in the most
obeisant Words and Behaviour, <i>That she was indif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>ferent
well, she humbly thank'd his Lordship</i>.&mdash;She
was of a lovely Height, with dark-brown Hair and
Eye-brows, black sparkling Eyes, and a fresh blushy
Complexion; and, whenever she exerted herself, had
an involuntary Flushing in her Breast, Neck and
Face, having continually a chearful Aspect, and a
fine Set of even white Teeth; never making an <i>Exit</i>,
but that she left the Audience in an Imitation of her
pleasant Countenance. Genteel Comedy was her chief
Essay, and that too when in Men's Cloaths, in which
she far surmounted all the Actresses of that and this
Age.&mdash;Yet she had a Defect scarce perceptible, <i>viz.</i>
her Right Shoulder a little protended, which, when
in Men's Cloaths, was cover'd by a long or Campaign
Peruke.&mdash;She was finely shap'd, and had very
handsome Legs and Feet; and her Gait, or Walk,
was free, manlike, and modest, when in Breeches.&mdash;Her
Virtue had its Reward, both in Applause and
<i>Specie</i>; for it happen'd, that as the Dukes of <i>Dorset</i>
and <i>Devonshire</i>, Lord <i>Hallifax</i>, and other Nobles,
over a Bottle, were all extolling Mrs. <i>Bracegirdle's</i>
virtuous Behaviour, Come, says Lord <i>Hallifax</i>&mdash;<i>You
all commend her Virtue, &amp;c. but why do we not
present this incomparable Woman with something
worthy her Acceptance?</i> His Lordship deposited
200 Guineas, which the rest made up 800, and sent
to her, with Encomiums on her Virtue.&mdash;She was,
when on the <i>Stage</i>, diurnally Charitable, going often
into <i>Clare-Market</i>, and giving Money to the poor
unemploy'd Basket-women, insomuch that she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
not pass that Neighbourhood without the thankful
Acclamations of People of all Degrees; so that, if
any Person had affronted her, they would have been
in Danger of being kill'd directly; and yet this good
Woman was an Actress.&mdash;She has been off the Stage
these 26 Years or more, but was alive <i>July 20, 1747</i>;
for I saw her in the <i>Strand, London</i>, then&mdash;with the
Remains of charming <i>Bracegirdle</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. <i>SANDFORD</i>, although not usually deem'd
an Actor of the first Rank, yet the Characters
allotted him were such, that none besides, then, or
since, ever topp'd; for his Figure, which was diminutive
and mean, (being Round-shoulder'd, Meagre-fac'd,
Spindle-shank'd, Splay-footed, with a sour
Countenance, and long lean Arms) render'd him a
proper Person to discharge <i>Jago</i>, <i>Foresight</i>, and
<i>Ma'lignij</i>, in the <span class="smcap">Villain</span>. But he fail'd in succeeding
in a fine Description of a triumphant Cavalcade,
in <i>Alonzo</i>, in the <span class="smcap">Mourning Bride</span>, because his
Figure was despicable, (although his Energy was, by
his Voice and Action, enforc'd with great Soundness
of Art, and Justice.)&mdash;This Person acted strongly
with his Face,&mdash;and (as King <i>Charles</i> said) was the
best Villain in the World.&mdash;He proceeded from the
<i>Sandfords</i> of <i>Sandford</i>, that lies between <i>Whitchurch</i>
and <i>Newport</i>, in Shropshire.&mdash;He would not be concern'd
with Mr. <i>Betterton</i>, Mrs. <i>Barry</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> as a
Sharer in the Revolt from <i>Drury-Lane</i> to <i>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</i>;
but said, <i>This is my Agreement</i>.&mdash;<i>To</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Samuel Sandford, <i>Gentleman</i>, Threescore Shillings
a Week.&mdash;&mdash;Pho! pho! <i>said Mr.</i> Betterton, <i>Three
Pounds a Week</i>.&mdash;&mdash;<i>No, no, said</i> Sandford;&mdash;<i>To</i>
Samuel Sandford, <i>Gentleman</i>, Threescore Shillings a
Week. For which <i>Cave Underhill</i>, who was a &frac34;
Sharer, would often jeer <i>Sandford</i>; saying, <i>Samuel
Sandford, Gent, my Man.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Go, you Sot, said
<i>Sandford</i>.&mdash;To which t'other ever replied, <i>Samuel
Sandford, my Man</i> Samuel.</p>

</div>
<hr class="pic" />



<p><i>CAVE UNDERHILL</i>, and Mr. <i>DOGGET</i>,
will be the next treated of.</p>



<p><i>CAVE UNDERHILL</i>, though not the best
Actor in the Course of Precedency, was more admired
by the Actors than the Audience&mdash;there being
then no Rivals in his dry, heavy, downright Way in
Low Comedy.&mdash;His few Parts were, The first Grave-digger
in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>,&mdash;<i>Sancho Pancha</i>, in the first Part
of <span class="smcap">Don Quixot</span>,&mdash;<i>Ned Blunt</i>, in the <span class="smcap">Rover</span>,&mdash;<i>Jacomo</i>,
in the <span class="smcap">Libertine</span>, and the <i>Host</i>, in the <span class="smcap">Villain</span>:&mdash;All
which were dry, heavy Characters, except
in <i>Jacomo</i>; in which, when he aim'd at any Archness,
he fell into downright Insignificance.&mdash;He was
about 50 Years of Age the latter End of King
<i>William's</i> Reign, about six Foot high, long and
broad-fac'd, and something more corpulent than this
Author; his Face very like the <i>Homo Sylvestris</i>, or
<i>Champanza</i>; for his Nose was flattish and short, and
his Upper Lip very long and thick, with a wide
Mouth and short Chin, a churlish Voice, and aw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>kward
Action, (leaping often up with both Legs at a
Time, when he conceived any Thing waggish, and
afterwards hugging himself at the Thought.)&mdash;&mdash;He
could not enter into any serious Character, much
more Tragedy; and was the most confin'd Actor I
ever saw: And could scarce be brought to speak a
short <i>Latin</i> Speech in <span class="smcap">Don Quixot</span>, when <i>Sancho</i> is
made to say, <i>Sit bonus Populus, bonus ero Gubernator</i>;
which he pronounced thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Shit bones and bobble arse,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Bones, and ears Goble Nature.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>He was obliged to Mr. <i>Betterton</i> for thrusting him
into the Character of <i>Merryman</i> in his <i>Wanton Wife</i>,
or <i>Amorous Widow</i>; but <i>Westheart Cave</i> was too
much of a Dullman.&mdash;His chief Atchievement was
in <i>Lolpoop</i>, in the <i>'Squire of Alsatia</i>; where it was
almost impossible for him to deviate from himself:
But he did great Injustice to Sir <i>Sampson Legend</i> in
<i>Love for Love</i>, unless it had been true, that the
Knight had been bred a Hog-driver.&mdash;In short,
<i>Underhill</i> was far from being a good Actor&mdash;as
appear'd by the late <i>Ben. Johnson's</i> assuming his
Parts of <i>Jacomo</i>&mdash;the Grave-digger in <i>Hamlet</i>&mdash;and
Judge <i>Grypus</i> in <i>Amphytrion</i>.&mdash;I know, Mr. <i>Underhill</i>
was much cry'd up in his Time; but I am so
stupid as not to know why.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. <i>DOGGET</i>, indeed, cannot reasonably be so
censur'd; for whoever decry'd him, must inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
have laugh'd much, whenever he saw him act.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Dogget</i> was but little regarded, 'till he chopp'd
on the Character of <i>Solon</i> in the <i>Marriage-Hater
Match'd</i>; and from that he vegetated fast in the
Parts of <i>Fondlewife</i> in the <i>Old Batchelor</i>&mdash;<i>Colignii</i>,
in the <i>Villain</i>&mdash;<i>Hob</i>, in the <i>Country Wake</i>&mdash;and <i>Ben</i>
the Sailor, in <i>Love for Love</i>.&mdash;But, on a Time, he
suffer'd himself to be expos'd, by attempting the
serious Character of <i>Phorbas</i> in <i>Oedipus</i>, than which
nothing cou'd be more ridiculous&mdash;for when he came
to these Words&mdash;(<i>But, oh! I wish</i> Phorbas <i>had
perish'd in that very Moment</i>)&mdash;the Audience conceived
that it was spoke like <i>Hob</i> in his Dying-Speech.&mdash;They
burst out into a loud Laughter;
which sunk <i>Tom Dogget's</i> Progress in Tragedy from
that Time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">
<i>F√¶lix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</i>
</p>

<p>But our present <span class="smcap">Laureat</span> had a better Opinion of
himself;&mdash;for, in a few Nights afterwards, <i>COLLEY</i>,
at the old Theatre, attempted the same Character;
but was hiss'd,&mdash;his Voice sounding like <i>Lord Foppington's</i>&mdash;<i>Ne
Sutor ultra Crepidam.</i></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Dogget</i> was a little, lively, spract Man, about
the Stature of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, Sen. Bookseller in B&mdash;h,
but better built.&mdash;His Behaviour modest, chearful,
and complaisant.&mdash;He sung in Company very agreeably,
and in Public very comically.&mdash;He danc'd the
<i>Cheshire Round</i> full as well as the fam'd Capt. <i>George</i>,
but with much more Nature and Nimbleness.&mdash;I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
had the Pleasure of his Conversation for one Year,
when I travell'd with him in his strolling Company,
and found him a Man of very good Sense, but
illiterate; for he wrote me Word thus&mdash;<i>Sir, I will
give you a</i> hole instead of (<i>whole</i>) <i>Share</i>.&mdash;He dress'd
neat, and something fine&mdash;in a plain Cloth Coat,
and a brocaded Waistcoat:&mdash;But he is so recent,
having been so often at <i>Bath</i>,&mdash;<i>satis est</i>.&mdash;He gave
his Yearly Water-Badge, out of a warm Principle,
(being a <i>staunch Revolution-Whig</i>.)&mdash;&mdash;I cannot part
with this <i>Nonpareil</i>, without saying, that he was the
most faithful, pleasant Actor that ever was&mdash;for he
never deceiv'd his Audience&mdash;because, while they
gaz'd at him, he was working up the Joke, which
broke out suddenly in involuntary Acclamations and
Laughter.&mdash;Whereas our modern Actors are fumbling
the dull Minutes, keeping the gaping Pit in Suspence
of something delightful a coming,&mdash;<i>Et parturiunt
Montes, nascitur ridiculus Mus</i>.</p>

<p>He was the best Face-player and Gesticulator,
and a thorough Master of the several Dialects,
except the <i>Scots</i>, (for he never was in <i>Scotland</i>) but
was, for all that, a most excellent <i>Sawney</i>. Whoever
would see him pictur'd, may view his Picture,
in the Character of <i>Sawney</i>, at the <i>Duke's Head</i> in
<i>Lynn-Regis</i>, in <i>Norfolk</i>.&mdash;&mdash;While I travell'd with
him, each Sharer kept his Horse, and was every
where respected as a Gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Jack Verbruggen</i>, in Point of Merit, will salute
you next.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>
<p><i>JACK VERBRUGGEN</i>, that rough Diamond,
shone more bright than all the artful, polish'd Brillants
that ever sparkled on our Stage.&mdash;(<i>JACK bore
the BELL away.</i>)&mdash;He had the Words perfect at
one View, and Nature directed 'em into Voice and
Action, in which last he was always pleasing&mdash;his
Person being tall, well-built and clean; only he was
a little In-kneed, which gave him a shambling Gate,
which was a Carelessness, and became him.&mdash;His
chief Parts were <i>Bajazet</i>, <i>Oroonoko</i>, <i>Edgar</i> in King
<i>Lear</i>, <i>Wilmore</i> in the <i>Rover</i>, and <i>Cassius</i>, when Mr.
<i>Betterton</i> play'd <i>Brutus</i> with him.&mdash;Then you might
behold the grand Contest, <i>viz.</i> whether Nature or
Art excell'd&mdash;<i>Verbruggen</i> wild and untaught, or
<i>Betterton</i> in the Trammels of Instruction.&mdash;-In
<i>Edgar</i>, in King <i>Lear</i>, <i>Jack</i> shew'd his Judgment
most; for his Madness was unlimited: Whereas he
sensibly felt a Tenderness for <i>Cordelia</i>, in these
Words, (speaking to her)&mdash;<i>As you did once know</i>
Edgar!&mdash;And you may best conceive his manly,
wild Starts, by these Words in <i>Oroonoko</i>,&mdash;<i>Ha! thou
hast rous'd the Lyon [in] his Den; he stalks abroad,
and the wild Forest trembles at his Roar:</i>&mdash;Which
was spoke, like a Lyon, by <i>Oroonoko</i>, and <i>Jack Verbruggen</i>;
for Nature was so predominant, that his
second Thoughts never alter'd his prime Performance.&mdash;The
late Marquess of <i>Hallifax</i> order'd
Oroonoko to be taken from <i>George Powel</i>, saying to
Mr. <i>Southern</i>, the Author,&mdash;That <i>Jack</i> was the unpolish'd
Hero, and wou'd do it best.&mdash;In the <i>Rover</i>
(<i>Wilmore</i>) never were more beautiful Scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>s than
between him, and Mrs. <i>Bracegirdle</i>, in the Character
of <i>Helena</i>; for, what with <i>Verbruggen's</i> untaught
Airs, and her smiling Repartees, the Audience were
afraid they were going off the Stage every Moment.&mdash;<i>Verbruggen</i>
was Nature, without Extravagance&mdash;Freedom,
without Licentiousness&mdash;and vociferous,
without bellowing.&mdash;&mdash;He was most indulgently soft,
when he says to <i>Imoinda</i>,&mdash;<i>I cannot, as I wou'd,
bestow thee; and, as I ought, I dare not.</i>&mdash;Yet, with
all these Perfections, <i>Jack</i> did, and said, more silly
Things than all the Actors besides; for he was
drawn in at the common Cheat of Pricking at the
Girdle, Cups and Balls, <i>&amp;c.</i> and told his Wife one
Day that he had found out a Way to raise a great
Benefit.&mdash;<i>I hope</i>, said she, <i>you'll have your</i> Bills
<i>printed in</i> Gold Letters.&mdash;<i>No, no, better than that</i>,
said he; <i>for I'll have the King's-Arms all in Gold
Letters</i>.&mdash;As Mr. <i>Verbruggen</i> had Nature for his
Directress in Acting, so had a known Singer, <i>Jemmy
Bowen</i>, the same in Music:&mdash;He, when practising a
Song set by Mr. <span class="smcap">Purcell</span>, some of the Music told
him to grace and run a Division in such a Place. <i>O
let him alone</i>, said Mr. <i>Purcell</i>; <i>he will grace it more
naturally than you, or I, can teach him</i>.&mdash;In short, an
Actor, like a Poet,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
<i>Nascitur, non fit.</i>
</p>

<p>And this Author prizes himself on that Attempt,
as he hath had the Judgment of all the best Critics
in the Character of <i>Fondlewife</i> in the <i>Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span> Batchelor</i>.&mdash;<i>If
you wou'd see Nature</i>, say they, <i>see</i> Tony
Aston&mdash;<i>if Art</i>, Colley Cibber;&mdash;and, indeed, I have
shed mock Tears in that Part often involuntarily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. <i>VERBRUGGEN</i> claims a Place next. She
was all Art, and her Acting all acquir'd, but dress'd
so nice, it look'd like Nature. There was not a
Look, a Motion, but what were all design'd; and
these at the same Word, Period, Occasion, Incident,
were every Night, in the same Character, alike; and
yet all sat charmingly easy on her.&mdash;Her Face,
Motion, <i>&amp;c.</i> chang'd at once: But the greatest, and
usual, Position was Laughing, Flirting her Fan, and
<i>je ne scay quois</i>,&mdash;with a Kind of affected Twitter.&mdash;She
was very loath to accept of the Part of <i>Weldon</i>
in <i>Oroonoko</i>, and that with just Reason, as being
obliged to put on Men's Cloaths&mdash;having thick Legs
and Thighs, corpulent and large Posteriours;&mdash;but
yet the Town (that respected her) compounded, and
receiv'd her with Applause; for she was the most
pleasant Creature that ever appear'd: Adding to
these, that she was a fine, fair Woman, plump, full-featur'd;
her Face of a fine, smooth Oval, full of
beautiful, well-dispos'd Moles on it, and on her Neck
and Breast&mdash;Whatever she did was not to be call'd
Acting; no, no, it was what she represented: She
was neither more nor less, and was the most easy
Actress in the World. The late Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oldfield</span>
borrow'd something of her Manner in free Comedy;&mdash;as
for Tragedy, Mrs. <i>Verbruggen</i> never attemp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>ted
it. <i>Melanthe</i> was her Master-piece; and the Part
of <i>Hillaria</i> in <i>Tunbridge-Walks</i> cou'd not be said to
be Acted by any one but her.&mdash;Her Maiden-Name
was <i>Percival</i>; and she was the Widow of Mr. <i>Mountford</i>,
(who was kill'd by Lord <i>Mohun</i>) when Mr.
<i>Verbruggen</i> married her.&mdash;She was the best Conversation
possible; never captious, or displeas'd at any
Thing but what was gross or indecent; for she was
cautious, lest fiery <i>Jack</i> shou'd so resent it as to breed
a Quarrel;&mdash;for he wou'd often say,&mdash;<i>Dammee! tho' I
don't much value my Wife, yet no Body shall affront
her, by G&mdash;d</i>; and his Sword was drawn on the least
Occasion, which was much in Fashion at the latter
End of King <i>William's</i> Reign;&mdash;at which Time I
came on the Stage, when Mr. <i>Dogget</i> left it; and
then the facetious <i>Joe Haines</i> was declining in Years
and Reputation, tho' a good Actor and Poet, his
Prologues exceeding all ever wrote.&mdash;[<i>Vide</i> Love
and a Bottle.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>JOE HAINES</i> is more remarkable for the
witty, tho' wicked, Pranks he play'd, and for his Prologues
and Epilogues, than for Acting.&mdash;He was, at
first, a Dancer.&mdash;After he had made his Tour of
<i>France</i>, he narrowly escaped being seiz'd, and sent to
the <i>Bastile</i>, for personating an <i>English</i> Peer, and
running 3000 Livres in Debt in <i>Paris</i>; but, happily
landing at Dover, he went to <i>London</i>, where in <i>Bartholomew-Fair</i>,
he set up a Droll-Booth, and acted a
new Droll, call'd, <i>The Whore of B<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>abylon, the Devil,
and the Pope</i>. This was in the first Year of King
<i>James</i> II. when <i>Joe</i> was sent for, and roundly
admonish'd, by Judge <i>Pollixfen</i> for it. <i>Joe</i> reply'd,
<i>That he did it in Respect to his</i> Holiness; <i>for, whereas
many ignorant People believed the</i> Pope <i>to be a</i> Beast,
<i>he shew'd him to be a fine, comely old Gentleman, as he
was; not with Seven Heads, and Ten Horns, as the</i>
Scotch <i>Parsons describe him</i>. However, this Affair
spoil'd <i>Joe's</i> expiring Credit; for next Morning, a
Couple of Bailiffs seiz'd him in an Action of 20<i>l.</i> as
the Bishop of <i>Ely</i> was passing by in his Coach.&mdash;Quoth
<i>Joe</i> to the Bailiffs,&mdash;<i>Gentlemen, here's my
Cousin, the Bishop of</i> Ely, <i>going into his House; let
me but speak to him, and he'll pay the Debt and
Charges</i>. The Bailiffs thought they might venture
that, as they were within three or four Yards of him.
So, up goes <i>Joe</i> to the Coach, pulling off his Hat,
and got close to it. The Bishop order'd the Coach
to stop, whilst <i>Joe</i> (close to his Ear) said softly, <i>My
Lord, here are two poor Men, who have such great
Scruples of Conscience, that, I fear, they'll hang themselves.</i>&mdash;Very
well, <i>said the Bishop</i>. So, calling to
the Bailiffs, he said, <i>You two Men, come to me To-morrow
Morning, and I'll satisfy you</i>. The Men
bow'd, and went away. <i>Joe</i> (hugging himself with
his fallacious Device) went also his Way. In the
Morning, the Bailiffs (expecting the Debt and
Charges) repair'd to the Bishop's; where being introduced,&mdash;<i>Well</i>,
said the Bishop, <i>what are your
Scruples of Conscience?</i>&mdash;<i>S<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>cruples!</i> (said the Bailiffs)
<i>we have no Scruples: We are Bailiffs, my Lord, who,
Yesterday, arrested your Cousin</i>, Joe Haines, <i>for
20l. Your Lordship promised to satisfy us To-day,
and we hope your Lordship will be as good as your
Word.</i>&mdash;The Bishop, reflecting that his Honour and
Name would be expos'd, (if he complied not) paid
the Debt and Charges.&mdash;There were two Parts of
Plays (<i>Nol Bluff</i> in the <i>Old Batchelor</i>, and <i>Roger</i> in
<i>√Üsop</i>) which none ever touch'd but <i>Joe Haines</i>.&mdash;I
own, I have copied him in <i>Roger</i>, as I did Mr.
<i>Dogget</i> in <i>Fondlewife</i>.&mdash;But, now, for another Story
of him.</p>

<p>In the long Vacation, when Harlots, Poets, and
Players, are all poor,&mdash;<i>Joe</i> walking in <i>Cross-Street</i>, by
<i>Hatton-Garden</i>, sees a fine Venison-Pasty come out
of <i>Glassop's</i>, a Pastry-Cook's Shop, which a Boy carried
to a Gentleman's House thereby.&mdash;<i>Joe</i> watch'd
it; and seeing a Gentleman knock at the Door, he
goes to the Door, and ask'd him if he had knock'd
at it: <i>Yes</i>, said the Gentleman; <i>the Door is open'd</i>.&mdash;In
goes the Gentleman, and <i>Joe</i> after him, to the
Dining-Room.&mdash;Chairs were set, and all ready for the
Pasty. The Master of the House took <i>Joe</i> for the
Gentleman's Friend, whom he had invited to Dinner;
which being over, the Gentleman departed.
<i>Joe</i> sat still.&mdash;Says the Master of the House to <i>Joe</i>,
<i>Sir, I thought you would have gone with your Friend</i>!&mdash;<i>My
Friend</i>, said <i>Joe</i>; <i>alas! I never saw him
before in my Life</i>.&mdash;<i>No, Sir</i>, replied the other:
<i>Pray, Sir, then how came you to Dinner here?</i>&mdash;<i>Si<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>r</i>,
said <i>Joe</i>, <i>I saw a Venison-Pasty carried in here; and,
by this Means, have din'd very heartily of it</i>. <i>My
Name is</i> Joe Haines, (said he) <i>I belong to the</i> Theatre.&mdash;<i>Oh,
Mr.</i> Haines, (continued the Gentleman) <i>you are
very welcome; you are a Man of Wit: Come, bring
t'other bottle</i>; which being finish'd, <i>Joe</i>, with good
Manners, departed, and purposely left his Cane behind
him, which he design'd to be an Introduction
to another Dinner there: For, next Day, when they
were gone to Dinner, <i>Joe</i> knock'd briskly at the
Door, to call for his Cane, when the Gentleman of
the House was telling a Friend of his the Trick he
play'd the Day before.&mdash;<i>Pray call Mr.</i> Haines <i>in</i>.&mdash;<i>So,
Mr.</i> Haines, said he; <i>sit down, and partake of
another Dinner</i>.&mdash;<i>To tell you the Truth</i>, said <i>Joe</i>, <i>I
left my Cane Yesterday on purpose</i>: At which they
all laugh'd.&mdash;Now <i>Joe</i> (altho' while greedily eating)
was very attentive to a Discourse on Humanity
begun, and continued, by the Stranger Gentleman;
wherein he advanced, that every Man's Duty was to
assist another, whether with Advice, Money, Cloaths,
Food, or whatever else. This Sort of Principle
suited <i>Joe's</i> End, as by the Sequel will appear. The
Company broke up, and <i>Joe</i>, and the Gentleman,
walk'd away, (<i>Joe</i> sighing as he went along.) The
Gentleman said to him, <i>What do you sigh for?</i>&mdash;<i>Dear
Sir</i>, (quoth <i>Joe</i>) <i>I fear my Landlord will, this Day, seize
my Goods for only a Quarter's Rent, due last Week</i>.&mdash;<i>How
much is the Money?</i> said the Gentleman.&mdash;<i>Fifty
Shillings</i>, said <i>Joe</i>, <i>and the P<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>atentees owe me Ten
Pounds, which will be paid next Week.</i>&mdash;<i>Come</i>, said
the Gentleman, <i>I'll lend thee Fifty Shillings on your
Note, to pay me faithfully in three Weeks</i>. Which
<i>Joe</i>, with many Promises and Imprecations, sign'd.&mdash;But
<i>Joe</i>, thereafter, had his Eyes looking out before
him; and, whenever he saw the Gentleman, would
carefully avoid him; which the Gentleman one Day
perceiv'd, and going a-cross <i>Smithfield</i>, met <i>Joe</i> full
in the Face, and, in the Middle of the <i>Rounds</i>, stopp'd
him. Taking him by the Collar, <i>Sirrah</i>, said he,
<i>pray pay me now, you impudent, cheating Dog, or I'll
beat you into a Jelly</i>.&mdash;<i>Joe</i> fell down on his Knees,
making a dismal Outcry, which drew a Mob about
them, who enquir'd into the Occasion, which was
told them; and they, upon hearing it, said to the
Gentleman, <i>That the poor Man could not pay it, if he
had it not</i>.&mdash;<i>Well</i>, said he, <i>let him kneel down, and
eat up that thin Sirreverence, and I'll forgive him,
and give up his Note</i>.&mdash;<i>Joe</i> promis'd he would, and
presently eat it all up, smearing his Lips and Nose
with the human Conserve. The Gentleman gave
him his Note; when <i>Joe</i> ran and embrac'd him,
kissing him, and bedaubing his Face, and setting
the Mob a hollowing.</p>

MEMOIRS OF THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES MENTIONED BY CIBBER,<br />
<small>TAKEN FROM EDMUND BELLCHAMBERS'S EDITION OF
THE "APOLOGY," 1822.</small></h2>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">William Smith.</span></p>

<p>This judicious actor, who is said to have been originally
a barrister, came into the Duke's Company,
when acting under Sir William D'Avenant, in Lincoln's Inn
Fields, about the year 1663. He rose soon after to the
duties of <i>Buckingham</i>, in "King Henry the Eighth," and
subsequently filled a range of characters distinguished by
their variety and importance. <i>Sir William Stanley</i>, in
Caryl's wretched play of the "English Princess," procured
him additional estimation and applause, which were still
farther enlarged by his performance of <i>Stanford</i> in Shadwell's
"Sullen Lovers." Mr. Smith was the original <i>Chamont</i>
in Otway's "Orphan," and played many parts of as much
local consequence in pieces that are now forgotten.</p>


<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;All passages enclosed in square brackets are by the present
editor, who is also responsible for the notes marked (L.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chetwood informs us that Mr. Smith was zealously
attached to the interests of King James the Second, in
whose army, attended by two servants, he entered as a
volunteer. Upon the abdication of that monarch, he returned
to the stage, by the persuasions of many friends,
who admired his performances, and resumed his original
part of <i>Wilmore</i> in the "Rover;" but having been received
with considerable disapprobation, on account of his party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>principles, the audience was dismissed, and he departed
from public life in the manner already mentioned. It is
difficult to reconcile these discrepancies. Chetwood's minuteness
looks like credibility, and Cibber has committed a
mistake in stating that Mr. Smith "entirely quitted" the
stage at this secession, he having returned in 1695, when
at the earnest solicitations of his sincere friends Mr. Betterton
and Mrs. Barry, strengthened by the influence of Congreve
over many of his connections in high life, he consented to
sustain the part of <i>Scandal</i> in that author's comedy of
"Love for Love," upon its production at the new theatre in
Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, when his inimitable performance
imparted an extra charm to that admirable play. Continued
peals of applause attested the satisfaction which his
auditors felt at the return of their old favourite, and it seems
singular that Congreve should have wholly overlooked this
memorable event, in the "prologue" at least, where the
defection of Williams and Mrs. Mountfort is thus obscurely
stated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Forbear your wonder, and the fault forgive</div>
<div class="i0">If in our larger family we grieve</div>
<div class="i0">One falling Adam, and one tempted Eve.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Smith continued on the stage till about twelve months
after this period, when, according to Downes, having a long
part in Banks's tragedy of "Cyrus," 1696, he fell sick on
the fourth day of performance, and died from a cold, as
Chetwood relates, occasioned by cramp, which having
seized him while in bed, he rose to get rid of it, and remained
so long in his naked condition, that a fever ensued from
disordered lungs, and, in three days, put an end to his
existence.</p>

<p>We have but a slender clue to the stage-management of
Mr. Smith, which was exercised over the Duke's Company
in Dorset-garden, conjointly with Betterton and Dr.
D'Avenant, when the famous agreement which bears their
signatures was concluded with Hart and Kynaston, for an
union of the theatres. It has been said that Booth [who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
wrote an epitaph on Smith] applied to him for an engagement,
which was refused from a fear of offending his
relatives, but with that kindness of expression and deportment
so warmly distinguished in his epitaph. This
assertion, however, is unfounded, for when Mr. Smith died,
Barton Booth was a Westminster scholar, and in the
fourteenth year of his age; the character of this eminent
comedian must, accordingly, have been drawn up from such
intelligence as the writer acquired at a subsequent period.</p>

<p>It only remains to be remarked, that Chetwood has
placed Mr. Smith's original return to the stage in the year
1692; but, not to insist upon the known looseness of this
writer's information, let us ask if a political offence would
be so vehemently remembered, after the lapse of four years,
as to drive an estimable actor from the harmless pursuance
of his ordinary duties? Cibber is doubtless correct in the
floating date of this fact, which must have happened <i>previous</i>
to the revolution. Mr. Smith was a principal actor
in Lee's later tragedies, but in the "Princess of Cleve," 4to,
1689, we find the part he would naturally have played to
Betterton's <i>Nemours</i>, supported by Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>Smith's value as an actor, may be immediately felt by a
reference to the parts he enjoyed under Betterton, with
whom he lived till death in the most cordial manner, enhancing
his fame by honourable emulation, and promoting
his interests by unbroken amity. No instance has been
recorded of their dissention or dispute, and from the notice
which Betterton extended to Booth, he very possibly communicated
that high account of his departed friend, which
the latter has recorded with such spirit and fidelity.</p>

<p>From Cibber's admission, it appears, that Smith's moral
qualities and professional excellence, procured him an extensive
reception among people of rank, a patronage which
his polished manners continued to exact, till society, by his
death, sustained one of its deepest deprivations. (B.) Chetwood's
story is now incapable either of proof or disproof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
The known facts about Smith's retirement are, that his name
appears to Constantine the Great, to Courtine in Otway's
"Atheist," and to Lorenzo in Southerne's "Disappointment,"
in 1684; that it then disappears, and does not again occur
till 1695. It is probable that he retired in 1684, as it is unlikely
that his name should not appear in one or other of
the 1685 bills. (L.)</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Charles Hart.</span></p>

<p>Charles Hart was the great nephew of Shakspeare, his
father, William, being the eldest son of our poet's sister
Joan. Brought up as an apprentice under Robinson, a
celebrated actor, he commenced his career, conformably to
the practice of that time, by playing female parts, among
which the <i>Duchess</i>, in Shirley's tragedy of the "Cardinal,"
was the first that exhibited his talents, or enhanced his
reputation.</p>

<p>Puritanism having gathered great strength, opposed
theatrical amusements as vicious and profane institutions,
which it was at length enabled to abolish and suppress.
On the 11th day of February, 1647,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> and the subsequent
22d of October, two ordinances were issued by the Long
Parliament, whereby all stage-players were made liable to
punishment for following their usual occupation. Before
the appearance of this severe edict, most of the actors had
gone into the army, and fought with distinguished spirit
for their unfortunate master; when, however, his fate was
determined, the surviving dependants on the drama were
compelled to renew their former efforts, in pursuance of
which they returned, just before the death of Charles, to
act a few plays at the "Cockpit" theatre, where, while performing
the tragedy of "Rollo," they were taken into custody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
by soldiers, and committed to prison.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Upon this occasion,
Hart, who had been a lieutenant of horse, under Sir Thomas
Dallison, in Prince Rupert's own regiment, sustained the
character of <i>Otto</i>, a part which he afterwards relinquished to
Kynaston, in exchange for the fierce energies of his ambitious
brother.</p>

<p>At the Restoration, Hart was enrolled among the company
constituting his Majesty's Servants, by whom the new
Theatre Royal, Drury-lane, was opened on the 8th of April,
1663, with Beaumont and Fletcher's play of the "Humourous
Lieutenant," in which he sustained a principal character
for twelve days of successive representation.</p>

<p>About the year 1667,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Hart introduced Mrs. Gwyn upon
the dramatic boards, and has acquired the distinction of
being ranked among that lady's first felicitous lovers, by
having succeeded to Lacy, in the possession of her charms.
Nell had been tutored for the stage by these admirers in
conjunction, and after testifying her gratitude to both,
passed into the hands of Lord Buckhurst, by whom she was
transferred to the custody of King Charles the Second.</p>

<p>The principal parts, according to Downes, sustained by
Mr. Hart, were <i>Arbaces</i>, in "King and No King;" <i>Amintor</i>,
in the "Maid's Tragedy;" <i>Othello</i>, <i>Rolla</i>, <i>Brutus</i>, and
<i>Alexander the Great</i>. Such was his attraction in all these
characters, that, to use the language of that honest prompter,
"if he acted in any one of these but once in a fortnight, the
house was filled as at a new play; especially <i>Alexander</i>, he
acting that with such grandeur and agreeable majesty, that
one of the court was pleased to honour him with this commendation&mdash;'that
Hart might teach any king on earth how
to comport himself.'" His merit has also been specified as
<i>Mosca</i>, in the "Fox," <i>Don John</i>, in the "Chances," and<i>Wildblood</i>, in an "Evening's Love;" which, however,
according to the same authority, merely harmonised with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
his general efforts, in commanding a vast superiority over
the best of his successors.</p>

<p>Rymer has said that Hart's action could throw a lustre
round the meanest characters, and, by dazzling the eyes of
the spectator, protect the poet's deformities from discernment.
He was taller, and more genteelly shaped than
Mohun, on which account he probably claimed the choice
of parts, and was prescriptively invested with the attributes
of youth and agility. He possessed a considerable share
in the profits and direction of the theatre, which were
divided among the principal performers; and besides his
salary of ¬£3 a week, and an allowance as a proprietor,
amounting to six shillings and three-pence a day, is supposed
to have occasionally cleared about ¬£1000 per annum.</p>

<p>[On the 14th of October, 1681, a memorandum was
signed between Dr. Charles Davenant, Betterton, and
Smith, of the one part, and Hart and Kynaston, of the
other, by which the two last mentioned, in consideration of
five shillings each for every day on which there shall be a
play at the Duke's Theatre, undertake to do all they can
to break up the King's Company. The result of this
agreement was the Union of 1682. This agreement is given
in Gildon's "Life of Betterton" (p. 8), and in Genest
(i. 369). I suppose it is a genuine document, but I confess
to some doubts, based chiefly on my belief that Betterton
was too honest to enter into so shabby an intrigue.]</p>

<p>Declining age had rendered Hart less fit for exertion
than in the vigour of life, and certain of the young actors,
such as Goodman and Clark, became impatient to get
possession of his and Mohun's characters. A violent
affliction, however, of the stone and gravel, compelled him
to relinquish his professional efforts, and having stipulated
for the payment of five shillings a-day, during the season,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
he retired from the stage, and died a short time after.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>
<p>Hart was always esteemed a constant observer of decency
in manners, and the following anecdote will evince his
respect for the clergy. That witty, but abandoned fellow,
Jo Haynes, had persuaded a silly divine, into whose
company he had unaccountably fallen, that the players
were a set of people, who wished to be reformed, and
wanted a Chaplain to the Theatre, an appointment for
which, with a handsome yearly income, he could undertake
to recommend him. He then directed the clergyman to
summon his hearers, by tolling a bell to prayers every
morning, a scheme, in pursuance of which Haynes introduced
his companion, with a bell in his hand, behind the
scenes, which he frequently rang, and cried out, audibly,
"Players! players! come to prayers!" While Jo and
some others were enjoying this happy contrivance, Hart
came into the theatre, and, on discovering the imposition,
was extremely angry with Haynes, whom he smartly reprehended,
and having invited the clergyman to dinner,
convinced him that this buffoon was an improper associate
for a man of his function.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Michael Mohun.</span></p>

<p>The life of Michael Mohun, though passed in its early
stages beneath a different teacher, was chequered by the
very shades which distinguished that of Hart, with whom
he acquired his military distinctions, and reverted to a
theatrical life. He was brought up with Shatterel, under
Beeston, at the "Cock-pit," in Drury-lane, where, in
Shirley's play of "Love's Cruelty," he sustained the part
of <i>Bellamente</i>, among other female characters,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and held it
even after the Restoration.</p>

<p>Having attained the rank of captain in the royal forces,
Mohun went to Flanders upon the termination of the civil
war, where he received pay as a major, and acquitted himself
with distinguished credit. At the Restoration, he resumed
his pristine duties, and became an able second to
Hart, with whom he was equally admired for superlative
knowledge of his arduous profession.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>
<p>He is celebrated by Lord Rochester, as the great √Üsopus
of the stage; praise, which, though coming from one of so
capricious a temper, may be relied on, since it is confirmed
by more respectable testimony. He was particularly remarkable
for the dignity of his deportment, and the elegance
of his step, which mimics, said his lordship, attempted to
imitate, though they could not reach the sublimity of his
elocution. The Duke's comedians, it would seem, endeavoured
to emulate his manner, when reduced by age and
infirmity, a baseness which the same noble observer has
thus warmly reprehended:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Mohun, from his inferior height and muscular form,
generally acted grave, solemn, austere parts, though upon
more than one occasion, as in <i>Valentine</i>, in "Wit without
Money," and <i>Face</i>, in the "Alchemist,"&mdash;one of his most
capital characters,&mdash;he was frequently seen in gay and
buoyant assumptions to great advantage. He was singularly
eminent as <i>Melantius</i>, in the "Maid's Tragedy;" <i>Mardonius</i>,
in "King and No King;" <i>Clytus</i>, <i>Mithridates</i>, and
the parts alluded to by Lord Rochester. No man had more
skill in putting spirit and passion into the dullest poetry than
Mohun, an excellence with which Lee was so delighted,
that on seeing him act his own King of Pontus, he suddenly
exclaimed, "O, Mohun, Mohun, thou little man of mettle,
if I should write a hundred plays, I'd write a part for thy
mouth!" And yet Lee himself was so exquisite a reader,
that Mohun once threw down a part in despair of approaching
the force of the author's expression. The "Tatler"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
has adverted to his singular science;<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> "in all his parts,
too," says Downes, "he was most accurate and correct;"
and perhaps no encomium can transcend the honours of
unbroken propriety.</p>

<p>About the year 1681, there are some reasons to suspect
that the king's company was divided by feuds and animosities,
which their adversaries in Dorset-garden so well
improved, as to produce an union of the separate patents.
Hart and Kynaston were dexterously detached from their
old associates, by the management of Betterton, whose
conduct, though grounded upon maxims of policy, can
derive no advantage from so unfair an expedient. Upon
the completion of this nefarious treaty, Mohun, who found
means to retain the services of Kynaston, with the remnant
of the royal company, continued to act in defiance of the
junction just concluded, as an independent body. Downes,
in his "Roscius Anglicanus," so far as the imperfect structure
of its sentences can be relied on, expressly asserts this;
and yet if "the patentees of each company united patents,
and, by so incorporating, the duke's company were made
the king's, and immediately removed to the Theatre Royal
in Drury-lane," what field did Mohun and his followers
select for their operations, to pitch their tents, and hoist
their standard? Till some period, at least, of the year
1682, this party were in possession of their antient domicile,
as Mohun at that time, acted <i>Burleigh</i>, in Banks's "Unhappy
Favourite," and sustained a principal character in
Southern's "Loyal Brother," with, for his heroine, in both
pieces, the famous Nell Gwyn.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span></p>
<p>[Bellchambers is here very inaccurate. The union of
1682 was, no doubt, opposed by some of the King's Company,
from November, 1681, when the memorandum between
Davenant, Betterton, Hart, and others, was executed, and
the date of the actual conclusion of the union. This is
clearly indicated in Dryden's Prologue on the opening of
Drury Lane by the united company on 16th November,
1682. But, whatever the opposition had been, it had ceased
then, because in the cast of the "Duke of Guise," produced
less than three weeks later, appear the names of Kynaston
and Wiltshire, whom Bellchambers represents as supporting
Mohun in his supposed opposition theatre. (L.)]</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Cardell Goodman.</span></p>

<p>Cardell Goodman, according to his own admissions, as
detailed by Cibber elsewhere, was expelled the university
of Cambridge, for certain political reasons, a disgrace, however,
which did not disqualify him for the stage. He came
upon it, accordingly, by repairing to Drury-lane th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>eatre,
where Downes has recorded [what was probably] his first
appearance, as <i>Polyperchon</i>, in the "Rival Queens," 4to.
1677. Here, although we cannot trace his success in any
character of importance, Mr. Cibber has adverted to his
rapid advances in reputation. He followed the fortunes of
Mohun in opposing the united actors, but, about three years
afterwards, resorted to them, (in 1685,) and sustained the
hero of Lord Rochester's "Valentinian." It is about this
period that his excellence must have blazed out as <i>Alexander
the Great</i>, since Cibber, who went upon the stage
in 1690, says Goodman had retired before the time of his
appearance.</p>

<p>The highest salary enjoyed at that period we are now
treating of, was six shillings and three pence per diem, a
stipend that was by no means equal to the strong passions
and large appetites of a gay, handsome, inconsiderate young
fellow. He was consequently induced to commit a robbery
on the highway, and sentenced upon detection, to make a
summary atonement for his fatal error; but this being the
first exploit of that kind to which the scantiness of his
income had urged him, King James was persuaded to
pardon him, a favour for which Goodman was so grateful,
that, in the year 1696, he shared with Sir John Fenwick in
a design to assassinate King William, who spared his life
in consideration of the testimony he was to render against
his accomplice. This condition, however, Goodman did not
fulfil, as he withdrew clandestinely to the continent, to avoid
giving evidence, and died in exile.</p>

<p>Having been selected as a fit instrument for her abandoned
pleasures by the Duchess of Cleveland, Goodman,
long before his death, became so happy in his circumstances,
that he acted only at intervals, when his titled mistress
most probably desired to see him; for he used to say, he
would not even act <i>Alexander</i>, unless his Duchess were in
front to witness the performance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Richard Estcourt.</span></p>

<p>Richard Estcourt, according to the biographical notice of
Chetwood, was born at Tewksbury, in Glostershire, in the
year 1668, and received a competent education at the Latin
grammar-school of his native town. Influenced by an early
attachment to the stage, he left his father's house, in the
fifteenth year of his age, with an itinerant company, and
on reaching Worcester, to elude the possibility of detection,
made his first appearance as <i>Roxana</i>, in the "Rival Queens."
Having received a correct intimation of this theatrical
purpose, his father sent to secure the fugitive, who slipped
away in a suit of woman's clothes, borrowed from one of
his kind-hearted companions, and travelled to Chipping-Norton,
a distance of five-and-twenty miles, in the course
of the day.</p>

<p>To prevent such excursions for the future, he was quickly
carried up to London, and apprenticed to an apothecary in
Hatton-garden, with whom, according to some authorities,
he continued till the expiration of his indentures, and duly
entered into business; which, either from want of liking or
success he soon afterwards renounced, and returned to his
favourite avocation.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Chetwood, on the contrary, asserts
that he broke away from his master's authority, and after
strolling about England for two years, went over to Dublin,
where his performances were sanctioned by ardent and
universal applause.</p>

<p>About the opening of the eighteenth century [that is,
18th October, 1704], Mr. Estcourt was engaged at Drury-lane
Theatre, where he made his d√©b√ªt as <i>Dominic</i>, in the
"Spanish Friar," and established his efforts, it is said, by a
close imitation of Leigh, the original possessor of that part.
In the year 1705 [should be 1706], such was his merit or
reputation, that Farquhar selected him for <i>Sergeant K<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>ite</i>,
in the "Recruiting Officer," a character to which Downes
has alluded in terms of unqualified praise. It is asserted
in the "Biographia Dramatica," that Mr. Estcourt was
"mostly indebted for his applause to his powers of mimicry,
in which he was inimitable; and which not only at times
afforded him opportunities of appearing a much better
actor than he really was,&mdash;by enabling him to copy very
exactly several performers of capital merit, whose manner he
remembered and assumed,&mdash;but also, by recommending him
to a very numerous acquaintance in private life, secured
him an indulgence for faults in his public profession, that
he might otherwise, perhaps, never have been pardoned."
As if an actor, in defiance of peculiar incapacity, associated
emulation, and public disgust, could maintain, for twelve
successive years, the very highest station in the Drury-lane
company, attainable by talents, such as he was only flattered
with possessing!</p>

<p>That Estcourt was happy in a "very numerous acquaintance,"
there is no reason to conceal or deny. He was remarkable
for the promptitude of his wit, and the permanence
of his pleasantry, qualifications that recommended him to
the most cordial intercourse with Addison, Steele, Parnell,
who has honoured him in a Bacchanalian poem, by the
name of Jocus, and other choice spirits of the age, who
enjoyed the variety of his talents, and acknowledged the
goodness of his heart. He was highly in favour with the
great Duke of Marlborough, but those who know his
grace's character, will hardly be surprised to learn that he
did not improve his fortune by that dazzling distinction.
Estcourt's honours, indeed, were strictly nominal, for though
constituted providore of the Beef-steak Club,&mdash;an assemblage
comprising the chief wits and greatest men of the
nation,&mdash;he gained nothing by the office but their badge of
employment,&mdash;a small golden gridiron, suspended from his
neck by a bit of green riband.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>
<p>If the foregoing remarks should be held sufficient to
redeem his dramatic character from the obloquy with which
it has so long been attended, the following anecdote will
perhaps be accepted as ample evidence of his great talent
for private mimicry.</p>

<p>Secretary Craggs, when very young, in company with
some of his friends, went, with Estcourt, to Sir Godfrey
Kneller's, and whispered to him that a gentleman present
was able to give such a representation of many among his
most powerful patrons, as would occasion the greatest surprise.
Estcourt accordingly, at the artist's earnest desire,
mimicked Lords Somers, Halifax, Godolphin, and others,
so exactly, that Kneller was delighted, and laughed heartily
at the imitations. Craggs gave a signal, as concerted, and
Estcourt immediately mimicked Sir Godfrey himself, who
cried out in a transport of ungovernable conviction, "Nay,
there you are out, man! By G&mdash;, that's not me!"</p>

<p>About a twelvemonth before his death, having retired
from the stage, Estcourt opened the Bumper tavern, in
Covent-garden, and by enlarging his acquaintance, most
probably shortened his days. He died in the year 1713
[should be 1712], and was buried near his brother comedian,
Jo Haynes, in the church-yard of St. Paul's, Covent-garden.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Thomas Betterton.</span></p>

<p>Thomas Betterton was born in Tothill-street, Westminster,
in the year 1635 [baptized 11th August, 1635], his
father at that time being under-cook to King Charles the
First. He received the rudiments of a genteel education,
and testified such a propensity to literature, that it was the
steadfast intention of his family to have had him qualified
for some congenial employment. This design, the confusion
and violence of the times most probably prevented, though
a fondness for reading induced them to consult his inclinations,
and he was accordingly apprenticed to Mr. Rhodes,
a respectable bookseller, residing at the Bible, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>in Charing-cross.</p>

<p>This person, who had been wardrobe-keeper to the
theatre in Blackfriars, before the suppression of dramatic
amusements, on General Monk's approach to London, in
the year 1659, obtained a license from the [governing
powers] to collect a company of actors, and employ them
at the "Cockpit," in Drury-lane. Here, while Kynaston,
his fellow-apprentice, sustained the principal female parts,
Betterton was distinguished by the vigour and elegance of
his manly personations. The fame of Beaumont and
Fletcher was then at its zenith, and in their plays of the
"Loyal Subject," and the "Mad Lover," added to "Pericles,"
the "Bondman," and the "Changeling," Mr. Betterton established
the groundwork of his great reputation.</p>

<p>Sir William D'Avenant having been favoured with a
patent before the civil wars broke out, obtained a renewal
of that royal grant upon the Restoration, and in the spring
of 1662 [should be June, 1661], after rehearsing various
plays at Apothecaries'-hall, he opened a new theatre in
Lincoln's-inn-fields, where Rhodes's comedians, with the
addition of Harris, and three others, were sworn before the
Lord Chamberlain, as servants of the crown, and honoured
by the sanction of the Duke of York.</p>

<p>Here Sir William D'Avenant produced his "Siege of
Rhodes," a play in two parts, embellished with such scenery
and decorations as had never been before exhibited on the
boards of a British theatre. The parts were strongly cast,
and this drama, assisted by its splendid appendages, was
represented for twelve days, successively, with unbounded
approbation.</p>

<p>At this period Mr. Betterton first assumed the part of
<i>Hamlet</i>, deriving considerable advantage from the hints of
Sir William D'Avenant, to whom the acting of Taylor
[who had been instructed by Shakespeare] had been formerly
familiar. Downes expressly declares that this character
enhanced Mr. Betterton's reputation to the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>,
and there is much collateral evidence to substantiate its
brilliant superiority.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Betterton was so favourably considered by Charles
the Second, that, upon his performance of <i>Alvaro</i>, in "Love
and Honour," he received that monarch's coronation-suit
for the character, as a token of esteem. Public opinion
kept pace with his efforts to secure it, and by evincing unparalleled
talent in such diversified parts as <i>Mercutio</i>, <i>Sir
Toby Belch</i>, and <i>Henry the Eighth</i>, (the last of which was
adopted from his manager's remembrance of Lowin) he
speedily attained to that eminence in his art, above which
no human exertion can probably ascend.</p>

<p>At the king's especial command, it has been asserted by
some of his biographers that Mr. Betterton went over to
Paris to take a view of the French stage, and suggest such
means as might ensure a corresponding improvement upon
our own. They even go so far as to term him the first who
publicly introduced our moving scenes, though Sir William
D'Avenant, to whom that honour decidedly belongs, had
attached them, less perfectly, perhaps, in 1658, to his
"Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>
<p>By or before 1663, Mr. Betterton had married Mrs.
Saunderson, a performer in the same company, of matchless
merit and unsullied virtue, though that event, by the
"Biographia Dramatica," and other incautious compilations,
is referred to the year 1670. This lady, it may be remarked,
was single, while denominated mistress; the appellation of
miss not being made familiar to the middle classes, till
after the commencement of the ensuing century.</p>

<p>The duke's company, notwithstanding the favour and
excellence to which Betterton, Harris, Smith, and other
members were admitted, began to feel its want of attraction
so forcibly, that Sir William D'Avenant was induced to try
the effects of a new theatre, which was accordingly opened,
with unparalleled magnificence, in Dorset-garden, Salisbury-court,
notwithstanding an earnest opposition by the city of
London, in November, 1671. Opinion, however, still inclining
to their antagonists, dramatic operas were invented,
and soon enabled the players at this place to achieve
a triumph over merit unassisted by such expensive
frivolity.</p>

<p>At the death of D'Avenant, on the 17th of April, 1668,
Mr. Betterton succeeded to a portion of the management,
and so great was the estimation in which both he and his
lady were held, that in the year 1675, when a pastoral,
called "Calisto; or, the Chaste Nymph," written by Mr.
Crown, at the request of King Charles's consort, was to be
performed at court by persons of the greatest distinction,
they were appointed to instruct them in their respective
parts. In 1682, an union was effected with the rival company,
which Mr. Betterton continued to direct, till Rich, in 1690,
obtained possession of the patent, and dispossessed him of
importance and authority.</p>

<p>Exasperated by ill treatment, Mr. Betterton confederated
with the principal performers to procure an independent
license, which being granted by King William, they built
a new theatre in Lincoln's-inn-fields, by subscription, and
opened it on the 30th of April, 1695, with Congreve's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
comedy of "Love for Love."</p>

<p>In 1705, enfeebled by age and infirmity, this distinguished
veteran transferred his license to Sir John Vanbrugh, who
erected a handsome theatre in the Haymarket, at which,
divested of influence or control, he accepted an engagement
as an actor.</p>

<p>Mr. Betterton's salary never exceeded eighty shillings a-week,
and having sustained the loss of more than ¬£2,000,
by a commercial venture to the East Indies, in 1692, necessity
compelled him to pursue his professional avocations.
On Thursday, April the 13th, 1709,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> the play of "Love for
Love" was performed for his benefit, an occasion which
summoned Mrs. Barry and Mrs. Bracegirdle from their
retirement, to aid this antient coadjutor by the resumption
of those parts they had originally sustained. Congreve is
said to have furnished a prologue, though withdrawn and
never submitted to print, which was delivered by the latter
lady, the former reciting an epilogue from the pen of Rowe,
which remains in lasting testimony of his affectionate regard.
From this address the following lines are worthy of
transcription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But since, like friends to wit, thus throng'd you meet,</div>
<div class="i0">Go on, and make the generous work complete;</div>
<div class="i0">Be true to merit, and still own his cause,</div>
<div class="i0">Find something for him more than bare applause.</div>
<div class="i0">In just remembrance of your pleasures past,</div>
<div class="i0">Be kind and give him a discharge at last;</div>
<div class="i0">In peace and ease life's remnant let him wear,</div>
<div class="i0">And hang his consecrated buskin here.</div>
</div></div>

<p>This hint, however, proved unavailing, and "Old Thomas"
still continued to labour, when permitted by intermissi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>ons
of disease, for that subsistence his age and his services
should long before have secured.</p>

<p>Mr. Betterton accordingly performed at intervals in the
course of the ensuing winter, and on the 25th of April, 1710
[should be 13th April], was admitted to another benefit,
which, with the patronage bestowed upon its predecessor,
is supposed to have netted nearly ¬£1000. Upon this occasion,
he was announced for his celebrated part of <i>Melantius</i>,
in the "Maid's Tragedy," from the performance of which
he ought, however, upon strict consideration, to have been
deterred; for having been suddenly seized with the gout, a
determination not to disappoint the expectancy of his
friends, induced him to employ a repellatory medicine,
which lessened the swelling of his feet, and permitted him
to walk in slippers. He acted, accordingly, with peculiar
spirit, and was received with universal applause; but such
were the fatal effects of his laudable anxiety, that the distemper
returned with unusual violence, ascended to his
head, and terminated his existence, in three days from the
date of this fatal assumption. On the 2nd of May his
remains were deposited with much form in the cloisters of
Westminster-abbey.</p>

<p>Mr. Betterton was celebrated for polite behaviour to the
dramatic writers of his time, and distinguished by singular
modesty, in not presuming to understand the chief points
of any character they offered him, till their ideas had been
asked, and, if possible, adopted. He is also praised in some
verses published with the "State Poems," for extending
pecuniary assistance to embarrassed writers, till the success
of a doubtful production might enable them to remunerate
their generous creditor. Indeed, Mr. Betterton's benevolence
was coupled with such magnanimity, that upon
the death of that unhappy friend to whose counsels his
little fortune had been sacrificed, he took charge of a surviving
daughter, educated her at considerable expense, and
not only made her an accomplished actress, but a va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>luable
woman.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Among many testimonies of deference to his judgment,
and regard for his zeal, the tributes of Dryden and Rowe
have been brilliantly recorded. He was naturally of a
cheerful temper, with a pious reliance upon the dispensations
of providence, and nothing can yield a higher idea of
his great affability, than the effect his behaviour produced
upon Pope, who must have been a mere boy, when first
admitted to his society. He sat to the poet for his picture,
which Pope painted in oil,<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and so eager was the bard to
perpetuate his memory, that he published a modernization
of Chaucer's "Prologues," in this venerable favourite's name,
though palpably the produce of his own elegant pen.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> As
an author, Mr. Betterton's labours were confined to the
drama, and if his original pieces are not entitled to much
praise, his alterations exhibit some judicious amendments.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Edward Kynaston.</span></p>

<p>Edward Kynaston made his first appearance in 1659, at
the "Cockpit" in Drury-lane, under the management of
Rhodes, to whom, in his trade of bookselling, he had previously
been apprenticed. Here he took the lead in personating
female parts, among which he sustained <i>Calis</i>, in
the "Mad Lover;" <i>Ismenia</i>, in the "Maid in the Mill;" the
heroine of Sir John Suckling's "Aglaura;" <i>Arthiope</i>, in t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>he
"Unfortunate Lovers;" and <i>Evadne</i>, in the "Maid's Tragedy."
The three last of these parts have been distinguished
by Downes and our author as the best of his efforts,
and being then but a "mannish youth," he made a suitable
representative of feminine beauty. Kynaston's <i>forte</i>, at this
period, appears to have consisted in moving compassion
and pity, "in which," says old Downes, "it has since been
disputable among the judicious, whether any woman that
succeeded him so sensibly touched the audience as he."</p>

<p>At the Restoration, when his majesty's servants re-opened
the "Red Bull" playhouse, in St. John-street, next shifted
to Gibbons's tennis-court, in Clare-market, and finally
settled, in 1663, at their new theatre in Drury-lane, Kynaston
was admitted to their ranks, and played <i>Peregrine</i>, in Jonson's
comedy of the "Fox." He also held <i>Sir Dauphine</i>, a
minor personage, in the same author's "Silent Woman," and
soon after succeeded to <i>Otto</i>, in the "Duke of Normandy,"
a part which was followed by others of variety and importance.</p>

<p>In derogation of Cibber's panegyric, we are assured by
Davies, upon the authority of some old comedians, that, from
his juvenile familiarity with female characters, Kynaston
contracted some disagreeable tones in speaking, which resembled
the whine or cant that genuine taste has at all
times been impelled to explode. When George Powel was
once discharging the intemperance of a recent debauch from
his stomach, Kynaston asked him if he still felt sick. "How
is it possible to be otherwise," said Powel, "when I hear
you speak?" Much as Kynaston, however, might have
been affected by the peculiarities of early practice, we cannot
consent, upon evidence such as this, to rob him of the
laurels that have sprung from respectable testimony.</p>

<p>In 1695 he followed the fortunes of Betterton to Lincoln's-inn-fields,
and supported a considerable character in John
Banks's "Cyrus the Great," produced the year after this
removal. The time of his retirement is not known, but i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>t
appears from our author that he continued upon the stage
till his memory and spirit both began to fail him. He had
left it, however, before 1706, when Betterton and Underhill
have been specified by Downes, as "being the only remains
of the Duke of York's servants," at that time before the
public. Kynaston died wealthy, and was buried in the
church-yard of St. Paul's, Covent-garden.</p>

<p>Kynaston bore a great resemblance to the noted Sir
Charles Sidley, a similitude of which he was so proud, that
he endeavoured to display it by the most particular expedients.
On one occasion, he got a suit of laced clothes
made in imitation of the baronet's, and appearing publicly
in it, Sir Charles, whose wit very seldom atoned for his ill-nature,
punished this vain propensity in his usual mischievous
manner. He hired a bravo to accost Kynaston
in the Park, one day when he wore his finery, pick a quarrel
with him on account of a pretended affront from his prototype,
and beat him unmercifully. This scheme was duly
put in practice, and though Kynaston protested that he
was not the person his antagonist took him for, the ruffian
redoubled his blows, on account of what he affected to consider
his scandalous falsehood. When Sir Charles Sidley
was remonstrated with upon the cruelty of this transaction,
he told the actor's friends that their pity was misplaced, for
that Kynaston had not suffered so much in his bones as <i>he</i>
had in his character, the whole town believing that it was
he who had undergone the disgrace of this chastisement.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">William Mountfort.</span></p>

<p>William Mountfort, according to Cibber's estimate, was
born in 1660, and having, I suppose, joined the king's company
at a very early age, about the year 1682, "grew," in
the words of old Downes, "to the maturity of a good actor."
At Drury-lane theatre, he sustained <i>Alfonso Corso</i>, in the
"Duke of Guise," in 1682. His rise was so rapid, that in 1685
we find him selected for the hero of Crowne's "Sir Courtly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Nice," "which," says Downes, "was so <i>nicely</i> performed," that
none of his successors, but Colley Cibber, could equal him.
Perhaps the last new character assumed by Mountfort was
<i>Cleanthes</i>, in Dryden's "Cleomenes," a play to which he
spoke the prologue.</p>

<p>I here present the reader with a narrative of those circumstances
attending the death of Mountfort, which have
so long been misunderstood and misrepresented.</p>

<p>A Captain Richard Hill had made proposals of marriage
to Mrs. Bracegirdle, which were declined from what Hill
appeared to consider an injurious preference for Mountfort,
between whom, though a married man, and the lady, at
least a platonic attachment was often thought to subsist.
Enraged at Mountfort's superior success, and affecting to
treat him as the only obstacle to his wishes, Hill expressed
a determination at various times, and before several
persons, to be revenged upon him, and as it was proved
upon the trial, coupled this threat with some of the bitterest
invectives that could spring from brutal animosity. Among
Hill's associates was Lord Mohun, a peer of very dissolute
manners, whose extreme youth afforded but a faint palliative
for his participation in the act of violence and debauchery
to which Hill resorted. This nobleman, however,
who seems to have felt a chivalric devotion to the interests
of his friend, engaged with Hill in a cruel and perfidious
scheme for the abduction of Mrs. Bracegirdle, whom Hill
proposed to carry off, violate, and afterwards marry. They
arranged with one Dixon, an owner of hackney carriages,
to provide a coach and six horses to take them to Totteridge,
and appointed him to wait with this conveyance
over against the Horse-shoe tavern in Drury-lane. A
small party of soldiers was also hired to assist in this
notable exploit, and as Mrs. Bracegirdle, who had been
supping at a Mr. Page's in Prince's-street, was going
down Drury-lane towards her lodgings in Howard-street,
Strand, about ten o'clock at night, on Friday the 9th <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>of
December, 1692, two of these soldiers pulled her away
from Mr. Page, who was attending her home, nearly
knocked her mother down, and tried to lift her into the
vehicle. Her mother, upon whom the blow given by these
ruffians had providentially made but a short impression,
hung very obstinately about her neck, and prevented the
success of their endeavours. While Mr. Page was calling
loudly for assistance, Hill ran at him with his sword drawn,
and again endeavoured to get Mrs. Bracegirdle into the
coach, a task he was hindered from accomplishing, by the
alarm that Page had successfully given. Company came
up, on which Hill insisted on seeing Mrs. Bracegirdle
home, and actually led her by the hand to the house in
which she resided. Lord Mohun, who during this scuffle
was seated quietly in the coach, joined Hill in Howard-street,
the soldiers having been previously dismissed, and
there they paraded, with their swords drawn, for about an
hour and a half, before Mrs. Bracegirdle's door. Hill's
scabbard, it ought to be remarked, was clearly proved to
have been lost during the scuffle in Drury-lane, and Lord
Mohun, when challenged by the watch, not only sheathed
his weapon, but offered to surrender it. These were strong
points at least in his lordship's favour, and deserve to be
noted, because the prescriptive assertion that Mountfort
was treacherously killed, is weakened by the establishment
of those facts. Mrs. Brown, the mistress of the house
where Mrs. Bracegirdle lodged, went out on her arrival,
to expostulate with Lord Mohun and his confederate, and
after exchanging a few words of no particular importance,
dispatched her maid servant to Mountfort's house,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> hard by
in Norfolk-street, to apprise Mrs. Mountfort of the danger
to which, in case of coming home, he would be subjected.
Mrs. Mountfort sent in search of her husband, but without
success, and the watch on going their round, between elev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>en
and twelve o'clock, found Lord Mohun and Hill drinking
wine in the street, a drawer having brought it from an
adjacent tavern. At this juncture Mrs. Brown, the landlady,
hearing the voices of the watch, went to the door with a design
of directing them to secure both Lord Mohun and Hill,
and some conversation passed upon that subject, although
her directions were not obeyed. Seeing Mountfort, just
as he had turned the corner into Howard-street, and was
apparently coming towards her house, Mrs. Brown hurried
out to meet him, and mention his danger, but he would not
stop, so as to allow her time for the slightest communication.
On gaining the spot where Lord Mohun stood, Hill
being a little farther off, he saluted his lordship with great
respect, and was received by him with unequivocal kindness.
Lord Mohun hinted to Mountfort that he had been
sent for by Mrs. Bracegirdle, in consequence of her projected
seizure, a charge which Mountfort immediately denied.
Lord Mohun then touched upon the affair, and Mountfort
expressed a hope, with some warmth, that he would not
vindicate Hill's share in the business, against which, while
disclaiming any tenderness for Mrs. Bracegirdle, he protested
with much asperity. Hill approached in time to
catch the substance of Mountfort's remark, and having
hastily said that he could vindicate himself, gave him a
blow on the ear, and at the same moment a challenge to
fight. They both went from the pavement into the middle
of the road, and after making two or three passes at each
other, Mountfort was mortally wounded. He threw down
his sword, which broke by the fall, and staggered to his
own house, where Mrs. Page, who had gone to concert with
Mrs. Mountfort for her husband's safety, hearing a cry of
"murder" in the street, threw open the door, and received
him pale, bleeding, and exhausted, in her arms. Hill fled
and escaped, but Lord Mohun, having surrendered himself,
was arraigned before parliament as an accomplice, on the
31st of January, 1693, and, after a laborious, patient, protracted,
and impartial trial, acquitted of the crime, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
he certainly bore no conspicuous part. Mountfort languished
till noon the next day, and solemnly declared, at
the very point of death, that Hill stabbed him with one
hand while he struck him with the other, Lord Mohun
holding him in conversation when the murder was committed.
From the fact, however, of Mountfort's sword
being taken up unsheathed and broken, there is no
doubt, without insisting upon the testimony to that effect,
that he used it; and that he could have used it after
receiving the desperate wound of which he died, does not
appear, by his flight and exhaustion, to have been possible.
Some of his fellow-players, it seems, had sifted the evidence
of a material witness, the day after his death, and at
this evidence they openly expressed their dissatisfaction.
Mountfort, it was indisputably shown, too, <i>went out of the
way to his own house</i>, in going down Howard-street at all,
as he ought to have crossed it, his door being the second
from the south-west corner. These circumstances will
perhaps support a conjecture that some part of the odium
heaped upon Lord Mohun and Hill has proceeded from the
cowardice and exasperation of a timid and vindictive fraternity,
coupled with the individual artifices of Mrs. Bracegirdle,
to redeem a character which the real circumstances
of Mountfort's death, dying as her champion, severely
affected. Cibber's assurance of her purity, may merely prove
the extent of his dulness or dissimulation, for on calmly
reviewing this case in all its aspects, chequered as it is by
Hill's impetuosity, Mrs. Bracegirdle's lewdness, and Mountfort's
presumption, I cannot help inferring that he fell a
victim, not unfairly, to one of those casual encounters which
mark the general violence of the times. The record of his
murder is therefore erroneous, and we may hope to see it
amended in every future collection of theatrical lives.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span></p>

<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Samuel Sandford.</span></p>

<p>Samuel Sandford made his first appearance upon the
stage, under D'Avenant's authority, in the year 1663,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> at
the time when that company was strengthened by the
accession of Smith and Matthew Medbourn. The first part
for which he has been mentioned by Downes, is <i>Sampson</i>,
in "Romeo and Juliet;" he soon after sustained a minor
part in the "Adventures of Five Hours," fol. 1663; and
when D'Avenant produced his comedy of the "Man's
the Master," he and Harris sung an eccentric epilogue in
the character of two street ballad-singers. Sandford was
the original <i>Foresight</i>, in "Love for Love," and though Mr.
Cibber has exclusively insisted upon his tragic excellence,
he must have been a comedian of strong and diversified
humour. When Betterton and his associates seceded to
the new theatre in Lincoln's-inn-fields, he refused to join
them as a sharer, but was engaged at a salary of three
pounds per week. As Sandford is not enumerated by
Downes among the actors transferred to Swiney, in the latter
end of 1706, when Betterton and Underhill, indeed, are
mentioned as "the only remains" of the duke's company,
it is clear he must have died during the previous six years,
having been referred to by Cibber, as exercising his profession
in 1700. His ancestors were long and respectably
settled at Sandford, a village in Shropshire; and he seems
to have prided himself, absurdly, upon the superiority of
his birth.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">James Nokes.</span></p>

<p>James Nokes formed part of the company collected at
the "Cockpit," in 1659, and is first mentioned by Downes
for <i>Norfolk</i>, in "King Henry the Eighth," some time after
D'Avenant's opening in Lincoln's-inn-fields. Upon this
assumption Mr. Davies has expressed a very reasonable
doubt, and conjectured, with much plausibility, that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>it was
sustained by Robert Nokes.</p>

<p>In Cowley's "Cutter of Coleman-street" [1661], the part
of <i>Puny</i> was allotted to Nokes, whose reputation at that
period appears to have been but feebly established, as the
more important comic characters were intrusted to Lovel
and Underhill. We find the name of Nokes affixed to
<i>Lovis</i>, in Etherege's "Comical Revenge," 1664, but his performance
of that part, whatever merit it might have
evinced, acquired no distinction. [This is wrong; Nokes
played Sir Nicholas Cully: the part of Lovis was acted by
Norris.] The plague then beginning to rage, theatrical
exhibitions were suspended, in May, 1665, and the company
ceased to act, on account of the great fire, till [about]
Christmas, 1666, when their occupation was resumed in
Lincoln's-inn-fields, and Lord Orrery produced his play
of "Mr. Anthony." In this piece there was an odd sort of
duel between Nokes and Angel, in which one was armed
with a blunderbuss, and the other with a bow and arrow.
Though this frivolous incident procured Nokes some accession
of public notice, it was Dryden's "Sir Martin Mar-all,"
[1667,] which developed his powers to their fullest extent,
and raised him to the highest pitch of popularity.</p>

<p>According to Downes, the Duke of Newcastle gave a
literal translation of Moli√®re's "Etourdi" to Dryden, who
adapted the part of <i>Sir Martin Mar-all</i> "purposely for the
mouth of Mr. Nokes;" and the old prompter has corroborated
Mr. Cibber's assertion of his success. Nokes
added largely to his reputation, in [1668], by performing
<i>Sir Oliver</i>, in "She would if she could;" and strengthened
Shadwell's "Sullen Lovers," by accepting the part of <i>Poet
Ninny</i>.</p>

<p>Nokes acted <i>Barnaby Brittle</i> at the original appearance&mdash;about
1670&mdash;of Betterton's "Amorous Widow," and [in
1671] performed <i>Old Jorden</i>, in Ravenscroft's "Citizen turned
Gentleman," a part which the king and court were said to
have been more delighted with than any other, except <i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>Sir
Martin Mar-all</i>. His <i>Nurse</i>, in "Caius Marius," 1680,
excited such uncommon merriment, that he carried the
name of Nurse Nokes to his grave. In 1688, he supported
the hero of Shadwell's "'Squire of Alsatia," a play which
was acted in every part with remarkable excellence, and
enjoyed the greatest popularity. We find no farther
mention of him, subsequent to this period, though included
by Cibber among those who were performing under the
united patents, in 1690, when he first came into the company.
According to Brown, who has peculiarly marked
out his "gaiety and openness" upon the stage, he kept a
"nicknackatory, or toy-shop," opposite the spot which has
since received the denomination of Exeter Change. The
date of his death is uncertain, but there is some reason to
presume that it happened about the year 1692.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">William Pinkethman.</span></p>

<p>The first mention of Pinkethman, by Downes, is for the
part of <i>Ralph</i>, in "Sir Salomon," when commanded at
court, in the beginning of [1704], but he had been alluded to,
two years before, in Gildon's "Comparison between the
Two Stages," as the "flower of Bartholomew-fair, and the
idol of the rabble. A fellow that overdoes every thing, and
spoils many a part with his own stuff." [He was on the
stage as early as 1692.] He is again mentioned in the
"Roscius Anglicanus" for <i>Dr. Caius</i>, in the "Merry Wives
of Windsor," and continued to act in the Drury-lane company
till his death, about the year 1725.</p>

<p>Pinkethman was a serviceable actor, notwithstanding his
irregularities, and performed many characters of great importance.
He was the original <i>Don Lewis</i>, in "Love makes
a Man," 1701, a proof that his talents were soon and greatly
appreciated. His eccentric turn led him, in too many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
instances, from the sphere of respectability, and we find
him in the constant habit of frequenting fairs, for the low
purpose of theatrical exhibition. His stage talents were
marred, it is true, by an extravagant habit of saying more
than had been "set down" for him; and though this
abominable blemish is fully admitted, still its toleration
proves that Pinkethman must have been an actor of uncommon
value. His son was a comedian of merit, who
played <i>Waitwell</i>, in the "Way of the World," at the
opening of Covent-garden theatre, in December, 1732, and
died in May, 1740.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Anthony Leigh.</span></p>

<p>The "famous Mr. Anthony Leigh," as Downes denominates
him, came into the duke's company, about the year [1672],
upon the deaths of several eminent actors, whose places he
and others were admitted to supply. He played <i>Bellair</i>,
<i>sen</i>., in Etherege's "Man of Mode," at its production in
1676. In 1681, Leigh supported <i>Father Dominic</i>, in
Dryden's "Spanish Friar;" a piece, which, according to the
"Roscius Anglicanus," was "admirably acted, and produced
vast profit to the company." Leigh's success was so
great in this character, that a full-length portrait was taken
of him in his clerical habit, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, for the
Earl of Dorset, from which a good mezzotinto engraving is
now in the hands of theatrical collectors. In 1685, we find
him allotted to <i>Sir Nicholas Calico</i>, in "Sir Courtly Nice;"
in 1688 he supported <i>Sir William Belfond</i>, in Shadwell's
"Squire of Alsatia," and these parts, with a few others,
appear to have constituted his peculiar excellence.</p>

<p>The satirical allusions of such a random genius as Brown,
are rarely to be relied upon, or we might suspect Leigh,
from the following extract, to have been distinguished by
pious hypocrisy:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>
<p>"At last, my friend Nokes, pointing to a little edifice,
which exactly resembles Dr. Burgess's conventicle in
Russel-court, says he, 'your old acquaintance Tony Leigh,
who turned presbyterian parson upon his coming into
these quarters, holds forth most notably here every
Sunday.'"&mdash;"Letters from the Dead to the Living" [1744,
ii. 77].</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Cave Underhill.</span></p>

<p>Cave Underhill was a member of the company collected
by Rhodes, and which, soon afterwards, submitted to the
authority of Sir William D'Avenant. He is first mentioned
by Downes, for his performance of <i>Sir Morglay Thwack</i>, in
the "Wits," after which he sustained the <i>Grave-digger</i>, in
"Hamlet," and soon testified such ability, that the manager
publicly termed him "the truest comedian" at that time
upon his stage.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Underhill, about this time, strengthened
the cast of "Romeo and Juliet," by playing <i>Gregory</i>, and
though the custom of devoting the best talent which the
theatres afford, to parts of minor importance, has ceased, it
is a practice to which the managers, were public amusement
consulted, might safely recur. In Shakspeare's
"Twelfth Night," which, says Downes, "had mighty success
by its well performance," Underhill soon after supported the
<i>Clown</i>, a character in which the latter attributes delineated
by Cibber, could alone have been employed. Underhill's
reputation appears to have been speedily established, as we
find him intrusted by Cowley, in [1661], with the hero of his
"Cutter of Coleman-street;" and he is mentioned by
Downes for especial excellence in performing <i>Jodelet</i>, in
D'Avenant's "Man's the Master." His first new part after
the accession of James, was <i>Hothead</i>, in "Sir Courtly Nice;"
on the 30th of April, 1695, he distinguished himself by his
chaste and spirited performance of <i>Sir Sampson Legend</i>, in
Congreve's "Love for Love," and in 1700, closed a long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
arduous, and popular career of original parts, by playing
<i>Sir Wilful Witwou'd</i>, in the "Way of the World." [He
continued on the stage till 1710.]</p>

<p>A brief account of this valuable comedian has been
furnished by Mr. Davies, which, for the satisfaction of our
readers, we shall proceed to transcribe.</p>

<p>"Underhill was a jolly and droll companion, who, if we
may believe such historians as Tom Brown, divided his gay
hours between Bacchus and Venus, with no little ardour.
Tom, I think, makes Underhill one of the gill-drinkers of
his time; men who resorted to taverns, in the middle of the
day, under pretence of drinking Bristol milk, (for so good
sherry was then called) to whet their appetites, where they
indulged themselves too often in ebriety. Underhill acted
till he was past eighty. He was so excellent in the part of
Trinculo, in the Tempest, that he was called Prince Trinculo.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
He had an admirable vein of pleasantry, and told
his lively stories, says Brown, with a bewitching smile.
The same author says, he was so afflicted with the gout,
that he prayed one minute and cursed the other. His
shambling gait, in his old age, was no hindrance to his
acting particular parts. He retired from the theatre in
1703."&mdash;"Dram. Misc.," iii. 138.</p>

<p>On the 31st of May, 1709, Underhill applied for a benefit,
and procured it, upon which occasion he played his
favourite part of the <i>Grave-digger</i>, and received the following
cordial recommendation from Sir Richard Steele:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My chief business here [Will's Coffee House] this
evening, was to speak to my friends in behalf of honest
Cave Underhill, who has been a comic for three generations;
my father admired him extremely when he was a boy. There
is certainly nature excellently represented in his manner of
action; in which he ever avoided that general fault in
players, of doing too much. It must be confessed, he h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>as
not the merit of some ingenious persons now on the stage,
of adding to his authors; for the actors were so dull in the
last age, that many of them have gone out of the world,
without having ever spoken one word of their own in the
theatre. Poor Cave is so mortified, that he quibbles and tells
you, he pretends only to act a part fit for a man who has
one foot in the grave; <i>viz.</i> a <i>Grave-digger</i>. All admirers of
true comedy, it is hoped, will have the gratitude to be
present on the last day of his acting, who, if he does not
happen to please them, will have it then to say, that it is
the first time."&mdash;"Tatler," No. 22.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">George Powell.</span></p>

<p>The father of George Powell was an actor in the king's
company at the time of its junction, in 1682, with the
duke's. Powell's access to the theatre was, therefore, easy;
and we are intitled to suspect, though the time is not to
be ascertained, that he began to act at a very early period.</p>

<p>Even, according to Cibber's allowance, when Powell was
appointed to the principal parts abandoned by Betterton
and his revolters, they were parts for which, whether serious
or comic, he had both elocution and humour. It is remarked
by Davies,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> that Cibber "seems to have hated
Powell," and if so, we have a ready clue to the neglect and
asperity with which he has treated him.</p>

<p>Powell succeeded Betterton, it is supposed, in the part
of <i>Hotspur</i>, when that excellent comedian exchanged its
choleric attributes, in his declining years, for the gaiety
and humour of <i>Falstaff</i>. <i>Edgar</i>, in "King Lear," was also
one of his most successful characters, but of this, owing to
his irregularities, he was dispossessed by Wilks. To such
a height, indeed, was the intemperance of this actor carried,
that Sir John Vanbrugh, in his preface to the "Relapse,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
4to, 1697, speaking of Powell's <i>Worthy</i>, has exposed it in
following manner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One word more about the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first
night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened;
but it was not my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, drinking his
mistress's health in Nantes brandy, from six in the morning to the time
he waddled on upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up
to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave up <i>Amanda</i> for gone,
and am since, with all due respect to Mrs. Rogers, very sorry she
escaped: for I am confident a certain lady, (let no one take it to herself
that is handsome) who highly blames the play, for the barrenness
of the conclusion, would then have allowed it a very natural close.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To the folly of intoxication he added the horrors of debt,
and was so hunted by the Sheriffs' officers, that he usually
walked the streets with a sword (sheathed) in his hand, and
if he saw any of them at a distance, he would roar out,
"Get on the other side of the way, you dog!" The bailiff,
who knew his old customer, would obligingly answer, "We
do not want you <i>now</i>, Master Powell." Harassed by his
distresses, and unnerved by drink, it is hardly to be wondered
at if his reputation decreased, and his ability
slackened; but that his efforts were still marked by a
possession of the very highest qualities that criticism can
attest, is proved by the following extract from the "Spectator:"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having spoken of Mr. Powell as sometimes raising himself applause
from the ill taste of an audience, I must do him the justice to own,
that he is excellently formed for a tragedian, and, when he pleases,
deserves the admiration of the best judges.&mdash;No. 40.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Addison and Steele continued their regard for this unhappy
man as long as they could render him any service,
and that he acted <i>Portius</i>, in "Cato," on its appearance in
1713, must have been with the author's approbation. The
last trace we have of Powell is confined to a playbill, for his
benefit, in the year 1717, since when no vestige has been
found of his career. He lies buried, it has been said, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span> the
vault of St. Clement-Danes; but though the period of his
death may be fixed not far from the date of this document,
it cannot be minutely ascertained. [Genest says Powell
died 14th December, 1714.]</p>

<p>In the intervals of excess Powell found time for repeated
literary labour, having written four plays, and superintended
the publication of three more. His fault was too great a
passion for social pleasure, but though the irregularities
this passion produced, disabled him from exerting the
talents he was allowed to possess, still his excellence on the
stage is not to be disputed. He was esteemed at one period
of his life a rival to Betterton, and had the prudence of his
conduct been equal to the vigour of his genius, he would
have held, as well as reached, that lofty station for which
nature had designed him.</p>

<p>If the testimony of Aston can be relied on, Powell was
born in the year 1658, being incidentally mentioned by
that facetious writer, as Betterton's junior by three and
twenty years.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">John Verbruggen.</span></p>

<p>John Verbruggen, it appears from the assertion of Mr.
Davies, was a dissipated young fellow, who determined, in
opposition to the advice of his friends, to be an actor, and
accordingly loitered about Drury-lane theatre, at the very
time when Cibber was also endeavouring to get admittance,
in expectation of employment. On the death of Mountfort,
whose widow he married, Verbruggen was intrusted, I have
no doubt, with the part of <i>Alexander</i>, his fondness for which
was such, that he suffered the players and the public, for
many years, to call him by no other name. [He seems to
have been called Alexander from his first appearing on the
stage, till 1694.] It is mentioned in more than one pamphlet,
that Cibber and Verbruggen were at variance, and
hence the animosity and unfairness with which th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>e latter
has been treated.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>The first part to which Verbruggen can be traced, is
<i>Aurelius</i>, in "King Arthur," 4to, 1691 [he played <i>Termagant</i>
("Squire of Alsatia") in 1688]: in the year 1696,
Mr. Southern assigned him the character of <i>Oroonoko</i>, by
the special advice of William Cavendish, the first Duke of
Devonshire; and as the author informs us in his preface,
"it was Verbruggen's endeavour, in the performance of
that part, to merit the duke's recommendation." A further
proof of Mr. Cibber's partiality, is the constant respect paid
to Verbruggen by such judges of ability as Rowe and Congreve,
for whose pieces he was uniformly selected. His
<i>Mirabel</i>, in the "Way of the World," and <i>Bajazet</i>, in
"Tamerlane," were parts of the highest importance, and it
will be difficult to show that an ordinary actor could have
been intrusted, by writers of equal power and fastidity, with
duties of which he was not thoroughly deserving. When
Verbruggen died it is impossible to ascertain. He pla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>yed
<i>Sullen</i>, in the "Beaux' Stratagem," at its production in
1707, and as Elrington made his appearance in <i>Bajazet</i>, in
1711, there is some reason to conclude that Verbruggen's
death occurred during that interval. [He died before April,
1708.]</p>

<p>Though Gildon, a scribbler whose venality was only exceeded
by his dulness, has mentioned Verbruggen in the
most derogatory terms,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> there is ample evidence in the bare
record of his business, to justify the most unqualified merit
we may incline to ascribe. Chetwood alludes to him, in
pointing out Elrington's imitation of his excellencies, as "a
very great actor in tragedy, and polite parts in comedy,"<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
and the author of the "Laureat" enumerates a variety of
important characters, in which he commanded universal
applause.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Joseph Williams.</span></p>

<p>Joseph Williams,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> who was bred a seal-cutter, came into
the duke's company, about the year 1673, when but a boy,
and according to the practice of that period, being apprenticed
to an eminent actor, "served Mr. Harris." I find him
first mentioned by Downes, for <i>Pylades</i>, in the serious opera
of "Circe;" his next character of importance being <i>Polydore</i>,
in the "Orphan," 1680; and, same year, <i>Theodosius</i>, in
Lee's tragedy of that name. The Union in 1682, without
diminishing his merit, appears to have lessened his value,
by the introduction of Kynaston and others, who had more
established pretensions to parts of importance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span></p>
<p>The secession of Williams from Betterton's company,
just before the opening in 1695, has been noticed and explained
by Mr. Cibber, in a subsequent passage. Greatly,
as I have no doubt, he has depreciated the merit of this
actor, no materials remain of a more recent date than those
already quoted, by which we may conjecture his talents, or
enforce his estimation. Williams is not to be confounded
with an actor of the same appellation, who was at Drury-lane
theatre in the year 1730, and relieved Cibber of <i>Scipio</i>,
in Thomson's "Sophonisba," a curious account of which is
given in the "Dramatic Miscellanies."</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Barry.</span></p>

<p>Elizabeth Barry, it is said, was the daughter of Edward
Barry, Esq., a barrister, who was afterwards called Colonel
Barry, from his having raised a regiment for the service of
Charles the First, in the course of the civil wars. The misfortunes
arising from this engagement, involved him in such
distress, that his children were obliged to provide for their
own maintenance. Lady D'Avenant, a relation of the noted
laureat, from her friendship to Colonel Barry, gave this
daughter a genteel education, and made her a constant
associate in the circle of polite intercourse. These opportunities
gave an ease and grace to Mrs. Barry's behaviour,
which were of essential benefit, when her patroness procured
her an introduction to the stage. This happened in
the year 1673, when Mrs. Barry's efforts were so extremely
unpropitious, that the directors of the duke's company
pronounced her incapable of making any progress in the
histrionic art. Three times, according to Curll's "History
of the Stage," she was dismissed, and by the interest of her
benefactor, re-instated. When Otway, however, produced
his "Alcibiades," in 1675, her merit was such, as not only
to excite the public attention, but to command the author's
praise, which has been glowingly bestowed upon her in the
preface to that production. We find her, next season, fil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>ling
the lively character of <i>Mrs. Lovit</i>, in Etherege's "Man of
Mode;" and in 1680, her performance of <i>Monimia</i>, in the
"Orphan," seems to have raised that reputation to its
greatest height, which had been gradually increasing. The
part of <i>Belvidera</i>, two years afterwards, and the heroine of
Southern's "Fatal Marriage," in 1694, elicited unrivalled
talent, and procured her universal distinction.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Barry first resorted to the theatre, her pretensions
to notice were a good air and manner, and a
very powerful and pleasing voice. Her ear, however, was
so extremely defective, that several eminent judges, on
seeing her attempt a character of some importance, gave
their opinion that she never could be an actress. Upon the
authority of Curll's historian, Mr. Davies<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> has compiled
what appears to me an apocryphal tale of her sudden rise
to the pinnacle of excellence, though there is no reason to
dispute her criminal intimacy with the Earl of Rochester.
I am not inclined, while doubting the precise anecdote of
his assistance, to deny that much advantage might have
been derived from his general instructions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry was not only remarkable for the brilliancy of
her talent, but the earnestness of her zeal, and the ardour
of her assiduity. Betterton, that kind, candid, and judicious
observer, bore this testimony to her eminent abilities, and
unyielding good-nature, that she often exerted herself so
greatly in a pitiful character, that her acting has given
success to plays which would disgust the most patient
reader.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> When she accepted a part, it was her uniform
practice to consult the author's intention. Her last new
character was the heroine of Smith's "Ph√¶dra and Hippolytus,"
and though Mrs. Oldfield and the poet fell out
concerning a few lines in the part of <i>Ismena</i>, Mrs. Barry
and he were in perfect harmony. [<i>Valide</i>, in Goring's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
"Irene," 1708, was her last new part.]</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry must have closed her career with this performance,
being mentioned by Steele, in the "Tatler," when
assisting at Betterton's benefit, on Thursday, April 7th,
1709, as "not at present concerned in the house." She
died on the 7th of November, 1713, aged fifty-five years, and
was buried in Acton church-yard. Mr. Davies ascribes her
death to the bite of a favourite lap-dog, who, unknown to
her, had been seized with madness, and there seems to be
no grounds for disturbing his supposition.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Betterton.</span></p>

<p>When Sir William D'Avenant undertook the management
of the duke's company, he lodged and boarded four
principal actresses in his house, among whom was Mrs.
Saunderson, the subject of this article.</p>

<p>Mrs. Saunderson's first appearance in D'Avenant's company,
was made as <i>Ianthe</i>, in the "Siege of Rhodes," on the
opening of his new theatre in Lincoln's-inn-fields, in April,
1662 [should be June, 1661]. She played <i>Ophelia</i> soon
afterwards, and that part being followed by Shakspeare's
<i>Juliet</i>, evinces the consideration in which her services were
held. [About] 1663, she married Mr. Betterton, and not
in 1670, as it is erroneously mentioned in the "Biographia
Dramatica," and other worthless compilations.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The principal characters sustained by Mrs. Betterton,
were <i>Queen Catharine</i>, in "Henry the Eighth;" the <i>Duchess
of Malfy</i>; the <i>Amorous Widow</i>; those enumerated in the
text, and many others, not less remarkable for their importance
than their variety. On the death of her husband, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
April, 1710, she was so strongly affected by that event, as
to lose her senses, which were recovered, however, a short
time previous to her own decease. Mr. Cibber may be
right in stating that she only enjoyed the bounty of her
royal mistress for about half a year; but, in that case, the
pension could not have been granted directly he died, as
we find that Mrs. Betterton was alive on the 4th of June,
1711, more than thirteen months after, and had the play of
"Sir Fopling Flutter," performed at Drury-lane for her
benefit. Mrs. Betterton, though prevented from performing,
by age and infirmity, enjoyed a sinecure situation in Drury-lane
theatre, till she withdrew from it, in 1709, and was
paid at the rate of [one pound] a-week. The "Biographia
Britannica" says she survived her husband eighteen months,
but the precise date of her decease has never been discovered.
[Mrs. Betterton made a will on 10th March,
1712. In all probability Bellchambers is right in supposing
that the annuity was not granted till some time after her
husband's death.]</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Benjamin Johnson.</span></p>

<p>This excellent actor, who was familiarly known by the
appellation of his great namesake, Ben Jonson, came into
the Theatre Royal, from an itinerant company, as Mr. Cibber
relates, about the year 1695. He was bred a sign painter, but
took more pleasure in hearing the actors, than in handling
his pencil or spreading his colours, and, as he used to say
in his merry mood, left the saint's occupation at last to take
that of the sinner.</p>

<p>Johnson's merit was evinced as <i>Sir William Wisewould</i>,
in Cibber's comedy of "Love's Last Shift," 4to, 1696; but
I find him first mentioned by Downes, for <i>Justice Wary</i>, in
Caryl's "Sir Salomon" [about 1704 or 1705]; the old
prompter, in a species of postscript to his valuable tract,
then terms him "a true copy of Mr. Underhill," and instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>s
his <i>Morose</i>, <i>Corbaccio</i>, and <i>Hothead</i>, as very admirable efforts.
Johnson passed over to the management of old Swiney, in 1706,
with other members of Betterton's company, and established
a very high reputation by his chaste and studied manner of
acting. When Rich, in 1714, opened his new theatre in
Lincoln's-inn-fields, Booth, Wilks, and Cibber, the managers
of Drury-lane, solicitous to retain in their service comedians
of merit, paid a particular respect to Johnson, by investing
him with such parts of Dogget, who had taken leave of
them, as were adapted to his powers. Here he continued
with fame and profit, till August, 1742, when he expired in
the seventy-seventh year of his age. Mr. Davies, who
appears to have been familiar with his excellencies, has
given a description of Johnson, which, for its evident taste
and candour, I shall do myself the pleasure to transcribe.</p>

<p>"That chaste copier of nature, Ben Johnson, the comedian,
for above forty years, gave a true picture of an arch clown
in the <i>Grave-digger</i>. His jokes and repartees had a strong
effect from his seeming insensibility of their force. His
large, speaking, blue eyes he fixed steadily on the person
to whom he spoke, and was never known to have wandered
from the stage to any part of the theatre."&mdash;"Dram. Misc.,"
iii. 140.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">William Bullock.</span></p>

<p>This excellent actor came to London, as we see, about 1695,
deriving his engagement from the distress in which Drury-lane
theatre was involved by the desertion of Betterton, and
other principal performers. He quitted this establishment
in 1714, owing, as Mr. Cibber insinuates, to the ungovernable
temper of Wilks; and passed over to John Rich, at
the opening of Lincoln's-inn-fields. He is first mentioned
by Downes, for the <i>Host</i>, in Shakspeare's "Merry Wives of
Windsor" [about 1704 or 1705], and appears to be pointed
at in Dennis's "Epistle Dedicatory" to the "Comical
Gallant," where the irascible writer thus addresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span> the Hon.
George Granville:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Falstaff's part, which you know to be the principal one
of the play, and that which on all the rest depends, was by
no means acted to the satisfaction of the audience, upon
which several fell from disliking the action, to disapproving
the play." [As noted before, p. 252, Bullock was probably
not the actor aimed at.]</p>

<p>This piece was printed in 1702, as acted "at the Theatre
Royal in Drury-lane;" with a list of the <i>dramatis person√¶</i>,
but the names of the actors not annexed. Bullock, however,
sustained the part of <i>Sir Tunbelly Clumsy</i>, in Vanbrugh's
"Relapse," which had been previously performed
under the same auspices, and from its nature, most probably
by the same actor.</p>

<p>William Bullock was a comedian of great glee and much
vivacity, and in his person large, with a lively countenance,
full of humourous information. Steele, in the "Tatler,"
with his usual kind sensibility, very often adverts to
Bullock's faculty of exciting amusement, but sometimes
censures his habit of interpolation.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> In Gildon's "Comparison
between the Two Stages," 1702 [p. 199], he is
termed the "best comedian since Nokes and Leigh, and a
fellow that has a very humble opinion of himself." Bullock's
abilities have been ratified by the sanction of Macklin, who
denominated him a true theatrical genius; and Mr. Davies
saw him act several parts with great applause, and particularly
the <i>Spanish Friar</i>, when beyond the age of eighty.
He died on the 18th of June, 1733. [Genest, iii. 593, points
out that Bullock was acting in 1739.]</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">John Mills.</span></p>

<p>Our first notice of this actor is found in the "Roscius
Anglicanus," where Downes, who seems anxious to dispatc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>h
his subject, says summarily that "he excels in tragedy,"
but without making the remotest allusion to any characters
in which his talent had been displayed.</p>

<p>John Mills the elder was, in person, inclined to the athletic
size; his features were large, though not expressive; his
voice was full, but not flexible; and his deportment was
manly, without being graceful or majestic. He was considered
one of the most useful actors that ever served in a
theatre, but though invested by the patronage of Wilks
with many parts of the highest order, he had no pretensions
to quit the secondary line in which he ought to have been
placed. Steele<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> taxes him very broadly with a want of
"sentiment," and insinuates that by making gesture too
much his study, he neglected the better attributes of his art.</p>

<p>On the death of Betterton, or soon after, Wilks, who
took upon himself to regulate the theatrical cast, gave
<i>Macbeth</i>, with great partiality, to Mills, while Booth and
Powell were condemned to represent the inferior parts of
<i>Banquo</i> and <i>Lenox</i>. Mills, though he spoke the celebrated
soliloquy on time,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">
To-morrow, and to-morrow, etc.,
</p>

<p>with propriety, feeling, and effect, wanted genius to realise
the turbulent scenes in which this character abounds. So
much, indeed, was his deficiency perceived, that the indignation
of a country gentleman broke out one night, during
the performance of this play, in a very odd manner. The
'squire, after having been heartily tired with Mills, on the
appearance of his old companion, Powell, in the fourth act,
exclaimed, loud enough to be heard by the audience, "For
God's sake, George, give us a speech, and let me go home."<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>I recollect an incident of the same sort occurring at
Bristol, where a very indifferent actor, declaimed so long
and to such little purpose, that an honest farmer, who sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
in the pit, started up with evident signs of disgust, and
waving his hand, to motion the speaker off, cried out,
"Tak' un away, tak' un away, and let's have another."</p>

<p>One of the best parts sustained by Mills, was that of
<i>Pierre</i>, which he acted so much to the taste of the public,
that the applause it produced him exceeded all that was
bestowed upon his best efforts in every thing else. He also
acted <i>Ventidius</i> with the true spirit of a rough and generous
old soldier, and in <i>Bajazet</i>, by the aid of his strong,
deep, melodious voice, he displayed more than ordinary
power.</p>

<p>It is supposed that Mills died in [December], 1736,
respected by the public as a decent actor, and beloved by
his friends as a worthy man.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Theophilus Keen.</span></p>

<p>Theophilus Keen received his first instructions in acting
from Mr. Ashbury, of the Dublin theatre, in which he made
his appearance about the year 1695. He most probably
came into the Drury-lane company with Johnson and
others, when Rich had beaten up for recruits. On the
opening of the new house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, he went
over to it, and, according to Chetwood, had a share not
only of the management, but in the profit and loss, which
latter speculation proved so disastrous to him, that he died
in the year 1719, of a broken heart. He was buried in the
church of St. Clement-Danes, and so much does he seem
to have been respected, that more than two hundred persons
in deep mourning, attended his funeral.</p>

<p>The influence he possessed in the theatre sometimes led
him to assume such parts as <i>Edgar</i>, <i>Oroonoko</i>, and <i>Essex</i>,
while his excellence lay in <i>Clytus</i>, and characters of a
similar cast. His figure and voice, though neither elegant
nor soft, were good, and his action was so complete, that it
obtained for him the epithet of majestic, and when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
spoke those lines of the <i>King</i>, in "Hamlet," where he
descants upon the dignity that "doth hedge" a monarch,
his look and whole deportment were so commanding, that
the audience accompanied them always with the loudest
applause.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mary Porter.</span></p>

<p>This valuable and respected actress, who was not only an
honour to the stage, but an ornament to human nature,
obtained the notice of Betterton by performing, when a
child, the <i>Genius of Britain</i>, in a Lord Mayor's pageant,
during the reign of Charles or James the Second. It
was the custom for fruit-women in the theatre formerly
to stand fronting the pit, with their backs to the stage, and
their oranges, &amp;c. covered with vine leaves, under one of
which Betterton threatened to put his little pupil, who was
extremely diminutive, if she did not speak and act as he
would have her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Porter was the genuine successor of Mrs. Barry, and
had an elevated consequence in her manner, which has
seldom been equalled. One of her greatest parts was
Shakspeare's <i>Queen Catherine</i>, in which her sensibility and
intelligence, her graceful elocution and dignified behaviour,
commanded applause and attention in passages of little
importance. When the scene was not agitated by passion,
to the general spectator she failed in communicating equal
pleasure; her recitation of fact or sentiment being so modulated
as to resemble musical cadence rather than speaking.
Where passion, however, predominated, she exerted her
powers to a supreme degree, and exhibited that enthusiastic
ardour which filled her audience with animation, astonishment,
and delight.</p>

<p>The dislocation of her thigh-bone, in the summer of
1731, was attended with a circumstance that deserves to
be recorded. She lived at Heywood-hill, near Hendon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
and, after the play, went home every night in a one-horse
chaise, prepared to defend herself against robbery, with
a brace of pistols. She was stopped on one of those
occasions by a highwayman, who demanded her money,
and having the courage to level one of her pistols at him,
the assailant, who was probably unfurnished with a similar
weapon, assured her that he was no common thief, and had
been driven to his present course by the wants of a starving
family. He told her, at the same time, where he lived, and
urged his distresses with such earnestness, that she spared
him all the money in her purse, which was about ten
guineas. The man left her, on which she gave a lash to
the horse, who suddenly started out of the track, overturned
her vehicle, and caused the accident already related. Let
it be remembered to this good woman's credit, that notwithstanding
the pain and loss to which he had, innocently,
subjected her, she made strict inquiry into the highwayman's
character, and finding that he had told the truth, she raised
about sixty pounds among her acquaintance, and sent it,
without delay, to the relief of his wretched family. There
is a romantic generosity in this deed that captivates me
more than its absolute justice.</p>

<p>About the year 1738, Mrs. Porter returned to the stage,
and acted many of her principal characters, with much
vigour and great applause, though labouring under advanced
age and unconquerable infirmity. She had the misfortune
to outlive an annuity upon which she depended, and died
in narrow circumstances, about the year 1762. [She published
Lord Cornbury's comedy of "The Mistakes," in
1758, by which she realized a large sum of money.]</p>

<p>Though her voice was harsh and unpleasing, she surmounted
its defects by her exquisite judgment. In person
she was tall and well shaped; her complexion was fair;
and her features, though not handsome, were made susceptible
of all that strong feeling could desire to convey.
Her deportment was easy, and her action unaffected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>; and
the testimony upon which the merits of Mrs. Porter are
placed, entitles us to rank her in the very first class of
theatrical performers.</p>


<p class="center f150"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Anne Oldfield.</span></p>

<p>Anne Oldfield was born in the year 1683, and would
have possessed a tolerable fortune, had not her father, a
captain in the army, expended it at a very early period.
In consequence of this deprivation, she went to reside with
her aunt, who kept the Mitre tavern, in St. James's-market,
where Farquhar, the dramatist, one day heard her reading
a few passages from Beaumont and Fletcher's "Scornful
Lady," in which she manifested such spirit, ease, and
humour, that being struck by her evident advantages for
the stage, he framed an excuse to enter the room, a little
parlour behind the bar, in which Miss Nancy was sitting.</p>

<p>Vanbrugh, who frequented the house, and was known to
Mrs. Oldfield's mother, received a communication from
that lady of the very great warmth with which his friend
Farquhar had extolled her daughter's abilities. Vanbrugh,
who seems to have been a zealous and sincere friend to all
by whom his assistance was courted, immediately addressed
himself to our heroine, and having ascertained that her
fancy tended to parts of a sprightly nature, he recommended
her to Rich, the manager of Drury-lane, by whom she was
immediately engaged, at a salary of fifteen shillings <i>per</i>
week. Her qualifications soon rendered her conspicuous
among the young actresses of that time, and a man of rank
being pleased to express himself in her favour, Mr. Rich
increased her weekly terms to the sum of twenty shillings.</p>

<p>The rise of Mrs. Oldfield was gradual but secure, and
soon after the death of Mrs. Verbruggen she succeeded to
the line of comic parts so happily held by that popular
actress.  Her <i>Lady Betty Modish</i>, in 1704, before which
she was little known, and barely suffered, discovered accompl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>ishments
the public were not apprised of, and rendered
her one of the greatest favourites upon whom their sanction
had ever been bestowed. She was tall, genteel, and well
shaped; her pleasing and expressive features were enlivened
by large speaking eyes, which, in some particular comic
situations, were kept half shut, especially when she intended
to realise some brilliant idea; in sprightliness of air, and
elegance of manner, she excelled all actresses; and was
greatly superior in the strength, compass, and harmony of
her voice.</p>

<p>Though highly appreciated as a tragic performer, Mrs.
Oldfield, in the full round of glory, used to slight her best
personations of that sort, and would often say, "I hate to
have a page dragging my train about. Why don't they
give Porter those parts? She can put on a better tragedy
face than I can." The constant applause by which she
was followed in characters of this description, so far reconciled
her to Melpomene, that the last new one in which she
appeared was Thomson's <i>Sophonisba</i>. Upon her action
and deportment the author has expressed himself with
great ardour in the following lines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Oldfield, in the character of <i>Sophonisba</i>, has excelled what,
even in the fondness of an author, I could either wish or imagine.
The grace, dignity, and happy variety, of her action have been universally
applauded, and are truly admirable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thomson's praise, indeed, is not more liberal than just,
for we learn, that in reply to some degrading expression of
<i>Massinissa</i>, relating to Carthage, she uttered the following
line,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
Not one base word of Carthage, for thy soul!&mdash;
</p>

<p>with such grandeur of port, a look so tremendous, and in a
voice so powerful, that it is said she even astonished Wilks,
her <i>Massinissa</i>; it is certain the audience were struck, and
expressed their feelings by the most uncommon applause.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Testimony like this is sufficient to protect her claim to
tragic excellence, eclipsed as it certainly is by the superiority
of her comic reputation.</p>

<p><i>Lady Townly</i> has been universally adduced as her <i>ne plus
ultra</i> in acting. She slided so gracefully into the foibles,
and displayed so humourously the excesses, of a fine
woman too sensible of her charms, too confident in her
strength, and led away by her pleasures, that no succeeding
<i>Lady Townly</i> arrived at her many distinguished excellencies
in the character. By being a welcome and constant visitor
to families of distinction, Mrs. Oldfield acquired a graceful
carriage in representing women of high rank, and expressed
their sentiments in a manner so easy, natural, and
flowing, that they appeared to be of her own genuine
utterance. Notwithstanding her amorous connexions<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> were
publicly known, she was invited to the houses of women
of fashion, as conspicuous for unblemished character as
elevated rank. Even the royal family did not disdain to
see Mrs. Oldfield at their levees. George the Second and
Queen Caroline, when Prince and Princess of Wales, often
condescended to converse with her. One day the Princess
told Mrs. Oldfield, she had heard that General Churchill
and she were married: "So it is said, may it please your
royal highness," replied Mrs. Oldfield, "but we have not
owned it yet."</p>

<p>In private, Mrs. Oldfield was generous, humane, witty,
and well-bred. Though she disliked the man, and disapproved
of his conduct, yet the misfortunes of Savage
recommended him to her pity, and she often relieved him
by a handsome donation. Her influence with Walpole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
contributed to procure his pardon when convicted, on false
evidence, of murder, and adjudged to death, a fate which
his most unnatural mother did her utmost to enforce. It
is not true that she either allowed this poet an annuity, or
admitted his conversation,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> but still the benefits she did
confer upon him were quite numerous enough to warrant
his celebration of her memory. The goodness of her heart,
and the splendour of her talents, were topics upon which
Savage might have ventured to insist, without endangering
his piety or wounding his pride. Dr. Johnson has sanctioned
the silence of this author,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> on the grounds of Mrs. Oldfield's
condition; but that dogmatic man would have shown a
truer taste for benevolence, had he recommended the most
ardent devotion to individuals of any stamp, who were
actuated by so glorious a principle.</p>

<p>Pope, who seems to have persecuted the name of player
with a malignancy unworthy of his genius, has stigmatised
the conversation of Mrs. Oldfield by the word "<i>Oldfieldismos</i>,"
which he printed in Greek characters; nor can there
be a doubt that he meant her by the dying coquette, in one
of his epistles. That Mrs. Oldfield was touched by the
vanity of weak minds, and drew an absurd importance
from the popularity of her low station, may be fairly
inferred, and might have been fairly derided;<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> but Pope,
with his usual want of candour, has appealed to less
tangible failings, and tried, as in most cases, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span> more to
ridicule the person than correct the fault. I do not dispute
the brilliancy of his sarcasm, but I would rather hail the
rigour of his justice.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Oldfield died on the 23d of October, 1730, most
sincerely lamented by those to whom her general value was
not unknown.</p>

 In Mr. Percy Fitzgerald's "New History of the English Stage"
(ii. 436) he gives an interesting memorandum by the Hon. Sir
Spencer Ponsonby-Fane regarding this point. It begins: "That
the Chamberlain's authority proceeded from the Sovereign alone
is clear, from the fact that no Act of Parliament, previous to the
10 Geo. II., c. 28 (passed in 1737), alludes to his licensing powers,
though he was constantly exercising them."</p>

 Langbaine, in his "Account of the English Dramatick Poets,"
1691, says (p. 212): "<i>Maids Tragedy</i>, a Play which has always
been acted with great Applause at the King's Theatre; and which
had still continu'd on the English Stage, had not King <i>Charles</i> the
<i>Second</i>, for some particular Reasons forbid its further Appearance
during his Reign. It has since been reviv'd by Mr. <i>Waller</i>, the
last Act having been wholly alter'd to please the Court."</p>

<p>I think there can be little doubt that the last reason suggested
by Cibber was the real cause of the prohibition.</p>

 In the "Biographia Dramatica" (iii. 24) the following note
appears: "Mary Queen of Scotland. A play under this title was
advertised, among others, as sold by Wellington, in St. Paul's
Churchyard, in 1703." But the work Cibber refers to is "The
Island Queens; or, the Death of Mary Queen of Scots," a
tragedy by John Banks, printed in 1684, but not produced till
6th March, 1704, when it was played at Drury Lane as "The

 Bellchambers notes here that this order was superfluous, because
the prohibition was inserted in the Patents given to Davenant
and Killigrew. But, whether superfluous or not, I find from the
Records of the Lord Chamberlain's Office that this order was
frequently made. On 16th April, 1695, an edict was issued forbidding
actors to desert from Betterton's company; on 25th July,
1695, desertions from either company were forbidden; and this
latter order was reiterated on 27th May, 1697.</p>




<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16">
<span class="label">[16]</span></a>
 I do not know whether it is merely a coincidence, but it is
curious that, after Betterton got his License (on 25th March,
1695), an edict was issued that no one was to desert from his
company to that of the Theatre Royal; while a general order
against any desertion from either company to the other was not
issued for more than three months after the first edict. The
dates, as given in the Records of the Lord Chamberlain's Office,
are 16th April and 25th July respectively. If this were intentional,
it would form a curious commentary on Cibber's statement.</p>




<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17">
<span class="label">[17]</span></a>
 Genest supposes that this incident occurred about June, 1704.
But the Lord Chamberlain's Records of that time contain no note
of it, and Cibber's language scarcely bears the interpretation that
three years elapsed between Powell's leaving Drury Lane and
returning to it, as was the case at that time; for he was at
Lincoln's Inn Fields for three seasons, 1702 to 1704. I find,
however, a warrant, dated 14th November, 1705, to apprehend
Powell for refusing to act his part at the Haymarket, so that the
audience had to be dismissed, and for trying to raise a mutiny in
the company. He was ordered to be confined in the Porter's
Lodge until further notice. On the 24th November Rich was
informed that Powell had deserted the Haymarket, and was
warned not to engage him. Now these desertions must have
followed each other pretty closely, for he was at Drury Lane in
the beginning of 1705; at the Haymarket in April of the same
year; and about six months later had deserted the latter. The sequel
to this difficulty seems to be the silencing of Rich for receiving
Powell, on 5th March in the fifth year of Queen Anne's reign,
that is, 1707. Unless the transcriber of the Records has made a
mistake in the year, Powell was thus suspended for about eighteen
months. It will be noticed that Cibber does not say that he was
acting the night after his release, but merely that he was behind
the scenes.</p>




<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18">
<span class="label">[18]</span></a>
 Among the Lord Chamberlain's Records is a copy of a decree
suspending all performances at Drury Lane because Powell had
been allowed to play. This is dated 3rd May, 1698. His offence
was that he had drawn his sword on Colonel Stanhope and young
Davenant. The suspension was removed the following day; but
on the 19th of the same month Powell was forbidden to be received
at either Drury Lane or Dorset Garden.</p>

 A warrant was issued to apprehend Dogget and take him to
the Knight Marshall's Prison, on 23rd November, 1697, his
offence being desertion of the company of Drury Lane and
Dorset Garden. The Records contain no note as to the termination
of the matter; but this is, beyond doubt, the occasion referred
to by Cibber.</p>

 This is a pretty way of putting what Johnson, in his Life of
Addison, afterwards stated in the well-known words: "The Whigs
applauded every line in which Liberty was mentioned, as a satire
on the Tories; and the Tories echoed every clap to show that the
satire was unfelt." In the next paragraph Johnson describes the
play as "supported by the emulation of factious praise."</p>

 "The Laureat" abuses Cibber for this sentence, declaring that

But Cibber's method of expression, though curious, does not
justify this attack.</p>

 Malone supposes that Skipwith acquired his shares from the
Killigrew family, but in the indenture by which he transferred
his interest to Brett, it seems as if he had acquired part of it from
Alexander Davenant, and the remainder by buying up shares of
the original Adventurers. The indenture will be found at length
in Mr. Percy Fitzgerald's "New History of the English Stage," i.
252. Skipwith is described in the "Biog. Dram." (i. 487) as "a
weak, vain, conceited coxcomb." The proportion in which the
shares were divided among the various holders is shown by the
"Opinion" of Northey and Raymond, in 1711, to have been this:
Three-twentieths belonged to Charles Killigrew. The remainder
was divided into tenths, of which two-tenths belonged to Rich;
the other eight parts were owned by the Mortgagees or Adventurers.
If Cibber's supposition is correct, two of these parts
belonged to Shipwith.</p>

 Davies ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 84) says: "The heads of the English
actors were, for a long time, covered with large full-bottomed
perriwigs, a fashion introduced in the reign of Charles II., which
was not entirely disused in public till about the year 1720.
Addison, Congreve, and Steele, met at Button's coffee-house, in
large, flowing, flaxen wigs; Booth, Wilks, and Cibber, when full-dressed,
wore the same. Till within these twenty-five years, our
Tamerlanes and Catos had as much hair on their heads as our
judges on the bench.... I have been told, that he [Booth] and
Wilks bestowed forty guineas each on the exorbitant thatching of
their heads."</p>

 "The Laureat," p. 66, relates with great acrimony an anecdote
of Colonel Brett's reproving Cibber harshly for his treatment
of an author who had submitted a play to him. Cibber is said to
have opened the author's M.S., and, having read two lines only, to
have returned it to him saying, "Sir, it will not do." Going to
Button's, he related his exploit with great glee, but was rebuked in
the strongest terms by Colonel Brett, who is said to have put him
to shame before the whole company. This is related as having
occurred many years after the time Cibber now writes of; the
suggestion being that Brett did not consider Cibber as a friend.</p>

 This was the Countess of Macclesfield, the supposed mother of
Richard Savage, who had a large fortune in her own right, of which
she was not deprived on her divorce from the Earl of Macclesfield.
Shortly after her divorce, probably about 1698, she married Brett.
She lived to be eighty, or over it, dying 11th October, 1753.</p>

 A comedy by Mountfort the actor, originally played at the
Theatre Royal, 1691. The part of Young Reveller was then
taken by the author, and we have no record of Cibber's playing it
before 1708; but from this anecdote he must have done so ten
years earlier.</p>

 In Boswell's Life of Johnson (i. 174) there is a note by
Boswell himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Mason, after having forfeited the title of Lady Macclesfield
by divorce, was married to Colonel Brett, and, it is said, was
well known in all the polite circles. Colley Cibber, I am informed,
had so high an opinion of her taste and judgement as to
genteel life, and manners, that he submitted every scene of his
<i>Careless Husband</i> to Mrs. Brett's revisal and correction. Colonel
Brett was reported to be too free in his gallantry with his Lady's
maid. Mrs. Brett came into a room one day in her own house,
and found the Colonel and her maid both fast asleep in two
chairs. She tied a white handkerchief round her husband's neck,
which was a sufficient proof that she had discovered his intrigue;
but she never at any time took notice of it to him. This incident,
as I am told, gave occasion to the well-wrought scene of Sir
Charles and Lady Easy and Edging."</p>

 The edict which ordered this division of plays and operas is
dated 31st December, 1707. Each theatre is ordered to confine
itself to its own sphere on pain of being silenced; and no other
theatre is permitted to be built. A copy of the edict is given by
Mr. Percy Fitzgerald ("New History," i. 258), but it is not a
<i>verbatim</i> copy of the original in the Lord Chamberlain's Office,

 At the Union, 1707-8, the Lord Chamberlain took measures
to assert his supremacy. Under date 6th January, 1708, he
orders that no actors are to be engaged at Drury-Lane who are
not Her Majesty's servants, and he therefore directs the managers
to send a list of all actors to be sworn in.</p>

 The whole passage regarding Nicolini is:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I went on <i>Friday</i> last to the Opera, and was surprised to find
a thin House at so noble an Entertainment, till I heard that the
Tumbler was not to make his Appearance that Night. For my
own Part, I was fully satisfied with the Sight of an Actor, who, by
the Grace and Propriety of his Action and Gesture, does Honour
to an human Figure, as much as the other vilifies and degrades
it. Every one will easily imagine I mean Signior <i>Nicolini</i>, who
sets off the Character he bears in an Opera by his Action, as
much as he does the Words of it by his Voice. Every Limb,
and every Finger, contributes to the Part he acts, insomuch that
a deaf Man might go along with him in the Sense of it. There
is scarce a beautiful Posture in an old Statue which he does not
plant himself in, as the different Circumstances of the Story give
Occasion for it. He performs the most ordinary Action in a
Manner suitable to the Greatness of his Character, and shows the
Prince even in the giving of a Letter, or the dispatching of a
Message. Our best Actors are somewhat at a Loss to support
themselves with proper Gesture, as they move from any considerable
Distance to the Front of the Stage; but I have seen the
Person of whom I am now speaking, enter alone at the remotest
Part of it, and advance from it with such Greatness of Air and
Mien, as seemed to fill the Stage, and at the same Time commanded
the Attention of the Audience with the Majesty of his
Appearance."&mdash;"Tatler," No. 115, January 3rd, 1710.</p>

 An excellent account of Mrs. Tofts is given by Mr. Henry
Morley in a note on page 38 of his valuable edition of the
"Spectator." She was the daughter of one of Bishop Burnet's
household, and had great natural gifts. In 1709 she was
obliged to quit the stage, her mental faculties having failed; but
she afterwards recovered, and married Mr. Joseph Smith, a
noted art patron, who was appointed English Consul at Venice.
Her intellect again became disordered, and she died about the
year 1760.</p>

 Cibber's most notorious blunder in language was made in this
sentence. In his first edition he wrote "was then <i>but</i> an Adept
in it," completely reversing the meaning of the word "Adept."
Fielding ("Champion," 22nd April, 1740) declares Cibber to be a
most absolute Master of English, "for surely he must be absolute
Master of that whose Laws he can trample under Feet, and which
he can use as he pleases. This Power he hath exerted, of which I
shall give a <i>barbarous</i> Instance in the Case of the poor Word
<i>Adept</i>.... This Word our great <i>Master</i> hath tortured and wrested
to signify a <i>Tyro</i> or <i>Novice</i>, being directly contrary to the Sense in
which it hath been hitherto used." It is of course conceivable
that the error was a printer's error not corrected in reading the proof.</p>

 Nicolini was the stage name of the Cavalier Nicolo Grimaldi.
Dr. Burney says: "This great singer, and still greater actor, was
a Neapolitan; his voice was at first a <i>soprano</i>, but afterwards
descended into a fine <i>contralto</i>." He first appeared, about 1694,
in Rome, and paid his first visit to England in 1708. Valentini
Urbani was a <i>castrato</i>, his voice was not so strong as Nicolini's,
but his action was so excellent that his vocal defects were not
noticed.&mdash;"General History of Music," 1789, iv. 207, 205.</p>

 Colonel Brett, by an indenture dated 31st March, 1708, made
Wilks, Estcourt, and Cibber, his deputies in the management of
the theatre. Genest (ii. 405) says this was probably "31st March,
1708, Old Style," by which I suppose he means March, 1709.
But I cannot see why he should think this. Brett entered into
management in January, 1708, and was probably out of it by
March, 1709. It may be that Genest supposes that this indenture
marks the end of Brett's connection with the theatre; whereas it
was probably one of his first actions. It will be remembered that
he stated his intention of benefitting Cibber by taking the Patent
(see <i>ante</i>, p. 42). A copy of the indenture is given by Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald ("New History," ii. 443). It is dated 31st March
in the seventh year of Queen Anne's reign, that is, 1708.</p>

 On p. 328 of vol. i., Cibber says that Rich (about 1705) had
led the Adventurers "a Chace in Chancery several years." From
the petition presented in 1709 against the order silencing Rich, we
learn that the principal Adventurers were: Lord Guilford, Lord
John Harvey, Dame Alice Brownlow, Mrs. Shadwell, Sir Edward
Smith, Bart., Sir Thomas Skipwith, Bart., George Sayer, Charles
Killegrew, Christopher Rich, Charles Davenant, John Metcalf,
Thomas Goodall, Ashburnham Toll, Ashburnham Frowd, William
East, Richard Middlemore, Robert Gower, and William Collier.
It is curious that everyone who has reproduced this list has, as far
as I know, mistaken the name "Frowd," calling it "Trowd." The
earliest reproduction of the list of names which I know is in the
"Dramatic Censor," 1811, col. <span class="smcap">III.</span></p>

Sir Thomas Skipwith.</p>

 This anecdote shows that Rich had some sort of Committee
of Shareholders to aid (or hinder) him. Subsequent experience
has shown, as witness the Drury Lane Committee at the beginning
of this century, how disastrous such form of management is.</p>

 Dr. Doran ("Their Majesties' Servants," 1888 edition, i. 103)
gives the following account of Goodman's connection with this
plot:&mdash;</p>

<p>"King James having saved Cardell's neck, Goodman, out of
pure gratitude, perhaps, became a Tory, and something more,
when William sat in the seat of his father-in-law. After Queen
Mary's death, Scum was in the Fenwick and Charnock plot to
kill the King. When the plot was discovered, Scum was ready to
peach. As Fenwick's life was thought by his friends to be safe if
Goodman could be bought off and got out of the way, the rogue
was looked for, at the <i>Fleece</i>, in Covent Garden, famous for homicides,
and at the robbers' and the revellers' den, the <i>Dog</i>, in Drury
Lane. Fenwick's agent, O'Bryan, erst soldier and highwayman,
now a Jacobite agent, found Scum at the <i>Dog</i>, and would then
and there have cut his throat, had not Scum consented to the
pleasant alternative of accepting ¬£500 a year, and a residence
abroad.... Scum suddenly disappeared, and Lord Manchester,
our Ambassador in Paris, inquired after him in vain. It
is impossible to say whether the rogue died by an avenging hand,
or starvation."</p>

 In the "Answer to Steele's State of the Case," 1720 (Nichols's
ed. p. 527), it is said: "After Mr. Rich was again restored to
the management of the Play-house, he made an order to stop a
certain proportion of the clear profits of every Benefit-play without
exception; which being done, and reaching the chief Players
as well as the underlings, zealous application was made to the
Lord Chamberlain, to oblige Mr. Rich to return the money stopped
to each particular. The dispute lasted some time, and Mr. Rich,
not giving full satisfaction upon that head, was silenced; during
the time of which silence, the chief Players, either by a new
License, or by some former (which I cannot absolutely determine,
my Memoirs being not at this time by me) set up for themselves,
and got into the possession of the Play-house in Drury-lane."</p>

 This warning is dated 30th April, 1709, and is a very peremptory
document. Rich's treasurer is ordered to pay the actors the
full receipts of their benefits, under deduction only of ¬£40 for the
charges of the house. See the Order for Silence quoted <i>post</i>,

 Mrs. Bracegirdle retired in February, 1707. Mrs. Barry
played up to the end of the season, 1708, that is, up to June,
1708. She does not seem to have been engaged in 1708-9, but
she was a member of the Haymarket Company in 1709-10.</p>




<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55">

 The Order for Silence has never, I believe, been quoted. I

the Order for Silence being issued on the next Monday.</p>

"Finding by divers of your late Papers, that you are a Friend to
the Profession of which I was many Years an unworthy Member,
I the rather make bold to crave your Advice, touching a Proposal
that has been lately made me of coming into Business, and the
Sub-Administration of Stage Affairs. I have, from my Youth,
been bred up behind the Curtain, and been a Prompter from the
Time of the Restoration. I have seen many Changes, as well of
Scenes as of Actors, and have known Men within my Remembrance
arrive to the highest Dignities of the Theatre, who made
their Entrance in the Quality of Mutes, Joynt-stools, Flower-pots,
and Tapestry Hangings. It cannot be unknown to the Nobility
and Gentry, That a Gentleman of the Inns of Court, and a deep
Intriguer, had some Time since worked himself into the sole
Management and Direction of the Theatre. Nor is it less notorious,
That his restless Ambition, and subtle Machinations, did
manifestly tend to the Extirpation of the good old <i>British</i> Actors,
and the Introduction of foreign Pretenders; such as Harlequins,
<i>French</i> Dancers, and <i>Roman</i> Singers; which, tho' they impoverish'd
the Proprietors, and imposed on the Audience, were for
some Time tolerated, by Reason of his dextrous Insinuations,
which prevailed upon a few deluded Women, especially the Vizard
Masks, to believe, that the Stage was in Danger. But his Schemes
were soon exposed, and the Great Ones that supported him withdrawing
their Favour, he made his <i>Exit</i>, and remained for a Season
in Obscurity. During this Retreat the Machiavilian was not idle,
but secretly fomented Divisions, and wrought over to his Side
some of the inferior Actors, reserving a Trap Door to himself, to
which only he had a Key. This Entrance secured, this cunning
Person, to compleat his Company, bethought himself of calling in
the most eminent of Strollers from all Parts of the Kingdom. I
have seen them all ranged together behind the Scenes; but they
are many of them Persons that never trod the Stage before, and
so very aukward and ungainly, that it is impossible to believe the
Audience will bear them. He was looking over his Catalogue of
Plays, and indeed picked up a good tolerable Set of grave Faces
for Counsellors, to appear in the famous Scene of <i>Venice Preserved</i>,
when the Danger is over; but they being but meer Outsides, and
the Actors having a great Mind to play the <i>Tempest</i>, there is not
a Man of them when he is to perform any Thing above Dumb
Show is capable of acting with a good Grace so much as the
Part of <i>Trincalo</i>. However, the Master persists in his Design,
and is fitting up the old Storm; but I am afraid he will not be
able to procure able Sailors or experienced Officers for Love or
Money.</p>

<p>"Besides all this, when he comes to cast the Parts there is so
great a Confusion amongst them for Want of proper Actors, that for
my Part I am wholly discouraged. The Play with which they
design to open is, <i>The Duke and no Duke</i>; and they are so put
to it, That the master himself is to act the Conjurer, and they
have no one for the General but honest <i>George Powell</i>.</p>

<p>"Now, Sir, they being so much at a Loss for the <i>Dramatis Person√¶</i>,
<i>viz.</i> the Persons to enact, and the whole Frame of the House
being designed to be altered, I desire your Opinion, whether you
think it advisable for me to undertake to prompt 'em: For tho'
I can clash Swords when they represent a Battel, and have yet
Lungs enough to huzza their Victories, I question, if I should
prompt 'em right, whether they would act accordingly.&mdash;I am</p>

<span style="margin-left:4em;">"<span class="smcap">J. Downes</span>.</span><br />

<p>"<i>P.S.</i> Sir, Since I writ this, I am credibly informed, That they
design a New House in <i>Lincoln's-Inn-fields</i>, near the Popish Chapel,
to be ready by <i>Michaelmas</i> next; which indeed is but repairing
an Old one that has already failed. You know the honest Man
who kept the Office is gone already."</p>

 An interesting advertisement was published on Rich's behalf
in July, 1709, which gives curious particulars regarding the actors'
salaries. I quote it from "Edwin's Eccentricities," i. 219-224,
without altering the figures, which, as regards the pence, are
rather eccentric:&mdash;</p>

pretence of hard usage from the Patentees, are about to

<p>"Some persons having industriously spread about amongst the
Quality and others, what small allowances the chief Actors have
had this last Winter from the Patentees of Drury Lane Play-house,
as if they had received no more than so many poor palatines; it
was thought necessary to print the following Account.</p>

<p>"The whole company began to act on the 12th of October, 1708,
and left off on the 26th of the same month, by reason of Prince
George's illness and death; and began again the 14th of December
following, and left off upon the Lord Chamberlain's order, on
the 4th of June last, 1709. So acted, during that time, in all 135
days, which is 22 weeks and three days, accounting six acting days
to a week.</p>

 The Lord Chamberlain's Records enable an exact account to
be given of the transactions which led to the formation of this
Haymarket Company. After Rich was silenced, his actors petitioned
the Lord Chamberlain on three separate occasions, namely,
10th June, 20th June, and 5th July, 1709, and in answer to their
petitions, the Haymarket, which was then devoted solely to
Opera, was permitted to be used for Plays also. In an Answer
to the actors' petitions, the Lord Chamberlain permits the manager
of the Haymarket to engage such of them as he wished, and
to act Plays four times a week, the other days being devoted to
Operas. This License is dated 8th July, 1709. This is, of course,
only a formal sanction of the private arrangement mentioned by
Cibber <i>ante</i> p. 69; and was resented by Booth and others who
were in Rich's favour. They therefore petitioned the Queen direct,
in despite of the Lord Chamberlain (see "Dramatic Censor," 1811,
col. 112; Genest, ii. 426; Mr. Fitzgerald's "New History," i. 273),
but no result followed, until Collier's advent, as is related further
on.</p>

 The description of the shape of the stage which follows is interesting
and valuable. In early times the stage was a platform surrounded
by the audience, not, as now, a picture framed by the proscenium.
This is evident, not only from descriptive allusions, but from the
two drawings which have come down to us of the interior of pre-Restoration
theatres&mdash;De Witt's drawing of the Swan Theatre in 1596,
reproduced in Herr Gaedertz's "Zur Kenntniss der altenglischen
B√ºhne" (Bremen, 1888), and the well-known print of the Red
Bull Theatre during the Commonwealth, which forms the frontispiece
to Kirkman's "The Wits, or Sport upon Sport" (1672). In
both of them the pit entirely surrounds the stage on three sides,
while the fourth side also contains spectators in boxes placed
above the entrance-doors. By gradual modifications the shape of
the stage has changed, till now the audience is confined to one
side. The doors used for entrances and exits, to which Cibber
alludes, have disappeared comparatively recently. They may be
seen, for instance, in Cruikshank's plates to Dickens's "Grimaldi."</p>

 The Haymarket opened on 15th September, 1709, and there
was no rival theatre till 23rd November, when Drury Lane
opened; but from this latter date till the end of the season both
theatres were open.</p>

 Bellchambers has here the following note:&mdash;"The monarch
alluded to, I suppose, was Victor Amadeus, King of Sardinia.
Carlo Broschi, better known by the name of Farinelli, was born in
the dukedom of Modena, in 1705, and suffered emasculation,
from an accident, when young. The Spanish king Ferdinand
created him a knight of Calatrava, honoured him with his friendship,
and added to his fortune. He returned to Italy on his
patron's death, and died in 1782."</p>

 Francesca Cuzzoni and Faustina Bordoni Hasse, whose
famous rivalry in 1726 and 1727 is here referred to, were singers
of remarkable powers. Cuzzoni's voice was a <i>soprano</i>, her
rival's a <i>mezzo-soprano</i>, and while the latter excelled in brilliant
execution, the former was supreme in pathetic expression. Dr.
Burney ("History of Music," iv. 319) quotes from M. Quantz the
statement that so keen was their supporters' party spirit, that
when one party began to applaud their favourite, the other party
hissed!</p>

 The trial opened on 27th February, 1710, and lasted for more
than three weeks. The political excitement it caused must have
done great harm to theatricals. Shadwell, in the Preface to "The
Fair Quaker of Deal," mentioned <i>post</i>, page 95, says it was a
success, "Notwithstanding the trial in Westminster-Hall, and the
rehearsal of the new opera."</p>

 In the British Museum will be found a copy of the report by
the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General, who were ordered by
Queen Anne to inquire into this business. Rich declared that
Collier broke into the theatre with an armed mob of soldiers, &amp;c.,
but Collier denied the soldiers, though he admitted the breaking
in. He gave as his authority for taking possession a letter signed
by Sir James Stanley, dated 19th November, 1709, by which the
Queen gave him authority to act, and required him not to allow
Rich to have any concern in the theatre. His authority was appointed
to run from 23rd November, 1709.</p>

 "Tatler," No. 99, 26th November, 1709: "<i>Divito</i> [Rich]
was too modest to know when to resign it, till he had the Opinion
and Sentence of the Law for his Removal.... The lawful
Ruler [of Drury Lane] sets up an Attorney to expel an Attorney,
and chose a Name dreadful to the Stage [that is Collier], who only
seemed able to beat <i>Divito</i> out of his Intrenchments.</p>

<p>"On the 22d Instant, a Night of public Rejoycing, the Enemies
of <i>Divito</i> made a Largess to the People of Faggots, Tubs, and
other combustible Matter, which was erected into a Bonfire before
the Palace. Plentiful Cans were at the same time distributed
among the Dependences of that Principality; and the artful Rival
of <i>Divito</i> observing them prepared for Enterprize, presented the
lawful Owner of the neighbouring Edifice, and showed his Deputation
under him. War immediately ensued upon the peaceful
Empire of Wit and the Muses; <i>The Goths</i> and <i>Vandals</i> sacking
<i>Rome</i> did not threaten a more barbarous Devastation of Arts and
Sciences. But when they had forced their Entrance, the experienced
<i>Divito</i> had detached all his Subjects, and evacuated all
his Stores. The neighbouring Inhabitants report, That the Refuse
of <i>Divito</i>'s Followers marched off the Night before disguised in
Magnificence; Door-Keepers came out clad like Cardinals, and
Scene-Drawers like Heathen Gods. <i>Divito</i> himself was wrapped
up in one of his black Clouds, and left to the Enemy nothing but
an empty Stage, full of Trap-Doors, known only to himself and his
Adherents."</p>

 Barton Booth, Theophilus Keen, Norris, John Bickerstaffe,
George Powell, Francis Leigh, George Pack, Mrs. Knight, Mrs.
Bradshaw, and Mrs. Moore were Collier's chief performers. As
most of them had signed the petition in Rich's favour which I
mentioned in a note on page 79, it is not wonderful that disturbances
soon arose. Collier appointed Aaron Hill to manage the
company, and his post seems to have been a somewhat lively one.
On 14th June, 1710, the Lord Chamberlain's Records contain an
entry which proves how rebellious the company were. Powell,
Booth, Bickerstaffe, Keen, and Leigh, are stated to have defied
and beaten Aaron Hill, to have broken open the doors of the
theatre, and made a riot generally. For this Powell is discharged,
and the others suspended. Mr. Fitzgerald ("New History," i. 308
<i>et seq.</i>) quotes a letter from Hill, in which some account of this
matter is given.</p>

 Charles Shadwell's "Fair Quaker of Deal" was produced at
Drury Lane on 25th February, 1710. In the Preface the author
says, "This play was written about three years since, and put into
the hands of a famous Comedian belonging to the Haymarket Playhouse,
who took care to beat down the value of it so much, as to
offer the author to alter it fit to appear on the stage, on condition
he might have half the profits of the third day, and the dedication
entire; that is as much as to say, that it may pass for one of his,
according to custom. The author not agreeing to this reasonable
proposal, it lay in his hands till the beginning of this winter, when
Mr. Booth read it, and liked it, and persuaded the author, that,
with a little alteration, it would please the town" (Bell's edition).
If, as is likely, Cibber is the actor referred to, his abuse of the
play and the actors is not unintelligible.</p>

 Hester Santlow, the "Santlow, fam'd for dance" of Gay,
married Barton Booth. She appears to have retired from the
stage about 1733. Genest (iii. 375) says, "she seems to have
been a pleasing actress with no great powers." Her reputation
was none of the best before her marriage, for she was said to have
been the mistress of the Duke of Marlborough and of Secretary
Craggs. See memoir of Booth.</p>

Rich: "He seems in his public capacity of Patentee and
Manager to have been a despicable character&mdash;without spirit to
bring the power of the Lord Chamberlain to a legal test&mdash;without
honesty to account to the other proprietors for the receipts of the
theatre&mdash;without any feeling for his actors&mdash;and without the least
judgment as to players and plays."</p>

 Rich's Patent was revived, as Cibber states (p. 78), in 1714,

 There is no more curious transaction in theatrical history
than the acquisition of the entire right in the Patent by Rich and his
son. Christopher Rich's share (see note on p. 32) was seventeen
one-hundredths, or about one-sixth; yet, by obstinate dishonesty,
he succeeded in annexing the remainder.</p>

 There has been some doubt as to the locality of the theatre in
Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, in which Betterton acted, one authority
at least holding that he played in Gibbons' Tennis Court in Vere
Street, Clare Market. But Cibber distinctly states that Rich
rented the building which Betterton left in 1705, and old maps of
London show clearly that Rich's theatre was in Portugal Street,
just opposite the end of the then unnamed street, now called
Carey Street. In "A New and Exact Plan of the Cities of
London and Westminster," published 30th August, 1738, by
George Foster, "The New Play House" is given as the name of
this building, and it is worthy of notice that Cibber, a few lines
above, writes of "the New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields." See
also vol. i. p. 192, note 1, where I quote Downes, who calls
Betterton's theatre the New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields.
About 1756 this house was made a barrack; it was afterwards an
auction room; then the China Repository of Messrs. Spode and
Copeland, and was ultimately pulled down about 1848 to make
room for the extension of the Museum of the Royal College of
Surgeons.</p>

 Westminster Bridge was authorized to be built in the face of
virulent opposition from the Corporation of London, who feared
that its existence would damage the trade of the City. Dr. Potter,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and others interested, applied for an
Act of Parliament in 1736; the bridge was begun in 1738, and
not finished till 1750, the opening ceremony being held on 17th
November of that year. Until this time the only bridge was
London Bridge. See "Old and New London," iii. 297.</p>

 "The Laureat" says these Irish actors were Elrington and
Griffith, but I venture to think that Evans's name should be substituted
for that of Griffith. All three came from Ireland to Drury
Lane in 1714; but, while Elrington and Evans played many
important characters, Griffith did very little. Again, I can find
no record of the latter's benefit, but the others had benefits in
the best part of the season. The fact that they had <i>separate</i>
benefits makes my theory contradict Cibber on this one point;
but what he says may have occurred in connection with one of
the two benefits. Cibber's memory is not infallible.</p>

 Theo. Cibber ("Life of Booth," p. 7) says that Colley Cibber
and Booth "used frequently to set out, after Play (in the Month
of <i>May</i>) to <i>Windsor</i>, where the <i>Court</i> then was, to push their
different Interests." Chetwood ("History," p. 93) states that the
other Patentees "to prevent his solliciting his Patrons at Court,
then at <i>Windsor</i>, gave out Plays every Night, where Mr. <i>Booth</i>
had a principal Part. Notwithstanding this Step, he had a Chariot
and Six of a Nobleman's waiting for him at the End of every Play,

 The dates regarding this quarrel with Dogget are very difficult
to fix satisfactorily. In the collection of Mr. Francis Harvey of
St. James's Street are some valuable letters by Dogget in connection
with this matter. From these, and from Mr. Percy Fitzgerald's
"New History" (i. 352-358), I have made up a list of
dates, which, however, I give with all reserve. We know from
"The Laureat" that Dogget had some funds of the theatre in
his hands when he ceased acting, and this fact makes a Petition
by Cibber and Wilks, that he should account with them for money,
intelligible. This is dated 16th January, 1714&mdash;it cannot be 1713,
as Mr. Fitzgerald says, for Booth was not admitted then, and the
quarrel had not arisen. Then follows a Petition from Cibber,
Booth, and Wilks, dated 5th February, 1714, praying the Chamberlain
to settle the dispute. Petitions by Dogget bear date 17th
April, 1714; and, I think, 14th June, 1714. Mr. Fitzgerald gives
this latter date as 14th January, 1714, and certainly the date on
the document itself is more like "Jan" than "June;" but in the
course of the Petition Dogget says that the season will end in a
few days, which seems to fix June as the correct month. The
season 1713-14 ended 18th June, 1714. Next comes a Petition
that Dogget should be compelled to act if he was to draw his
share of the profits, which is dated 3rd November, 1714. In this
case we are on sure ground, for the Petition is preserved among
the Lord Chamberlain's Papers. Another Petition by Dogget, in
which he talks of his being forced into Westminster Hall to obtain
his rights, is dated "Jan. ye 6 1714," that is, 1715. After this, legal
action was no doubt commenced, as related by Cibber.</p>

was Dogget's last appearance; for a week after he played Ben in

after the lapse of another week (April 1st, 1717), when he

 In the Dedication to Steele of "Ximena" (1719) Cibber
warmly acknowledges the great service Steele had done to the
theatre, not only in improving the tone of its performances, but
also in the mere attracting of public attention to it. "How many
a time," he says, "have we known the most elegant Audiences
drawn together at a Day's Warning, by the Influence or Warrant
of a single <i>Tatler</i>, when our best Endeavours without it, could not
defray the Charge of the Performance." In the same Dedication
Cibber's gratitude overstepped his judgment, in applying to Steele's
generous acknowledgment of his indebtedness to Addison's help
in his "Spectator," &amp;c., Dryden's lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Fool that I was! upon my Eagle's Wings</div>
<div class="i0">I bore this Wren, 'till I was tir'd with soaring,</div>
<div class="i0">And now, he mounts above me&mdash;&mdash;"</div>
</div></div>

<p>The following Epigram is quoted in "The Laureat," p. 76. It
originally appeared in "Mist's Journal," 31st October, 1719:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"<i>Thus</i> Colley Cibber <i>to his Partner</i> Steele,</div>
<div class="i0"><i>See here, Sir Knight, how I've outdone</i> Corneille;</div>
<div class="i0"><i>See here, how I, my Patron to inveigle,</i></div>

<div class="i0"><i>Safe to the silent Shades, we bid Defiance;</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>For living Dogs are better than dead Lions</i>."</div>
</div></div>

<p>In one of his Odes, at which Johnson laughed (Boswell, i. 402)
Cibber had the couplet:&mdash;</p>

Steele, in connection with his being deprived of the Patent, he
accused Cibber of impiety and various other crimes and misdemeanours;

in the "Daily Post": "Ten Pounds will be paid by Mr. <span class="smcap">Cibber</span>,

 George Pack is an actor of whom Chetwood ("History," p.

performing the female parts in duets with Leveridge. His first
appearance chronicled by Genest was at Lincoln's Inn Fields in
1700, as Westmoreland in the first part of "Henry IV." Chetwood

Maiden in "Tunbridge Walks," Beau Mizen in "The Fair Quaker

Characters</i>." On 10th March, 1722, he announced his last appearance
on any stage; but he returned on 21st April and 7th May,
1724, on which latter date he had a benefit. Chetwood says that
on his retirement he opened the Globe Tavern, near Charing-Cross,
over against the Hay-Market. When Chetwood wrote (1749)
Pack was no longer alive.</p>

 In the "Weekly Packet," 18th December, 1714, the following
appears:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This Day the New Play-House in Lincolns-Inn Fields, is to be
open'd and a Comedy acted there, call'd, The Recruiting Officer,
by the Company that act under the Patent; tho' it is said, that
some of the Gentlemen who have left the House in Drury-Lane
for that Service, are order'd to return to their Colours, upon Pain
of not exercising their Lungs elsewhere; which may in Time prove
of ill Service to the Patentee, that has been at vast Expence to
make his Theatre as convenient for the Reception of an Audience
as any one can possibly be."</p>

<p>Genest remarks that this seems to show that the Lord Chamberlain
threatened to interfere in the interests of Drury Lane. He
adds: "Cibber's silence proves nothing to the contrary, as in more
than one instance he does not tell the whole truth" (ii. 565). In
defence of Cibber I may say that the Chamberlain's Records
contain no hint that he threatened to interfere with the Lincoln's
Inn Fields Theatre or its actors.</p>

 The managers also expended money on the decoration of the
theatre before the beginning of the next season after the Patent
was granted. In the "Daily Courant," 6th October, 1715, they
advertise: "His Majesty's Company of Comedians give Notice,

<p>"Well, Sir, when the winter came on, what was done by your

<div class="i0">Swift to whose hand a winged volume flies:</div>

 In leaping from 1717 to 1728, as Cibber does here, he omits
to notice much that is of the greatest interest in stage history.
Steele's connection with the theatre was of a chequered complexion,
and it is curious as well as regrettable that an interested observer
like Cibber should have simply ignored the great points which
were at issue while Steele was a sharer in the Patent. In order
to bridge over the chasm I give a bare record of Steele's transactions
in connection with the Patent.</p>

<p>His first authority was a Licence granted to him and his
partners, Wilks, Cibber, Dogget, and Booth, and dated October
18th, 1714. This was followed by a Patent, in Steele's name
alone, for the term of his life, and three years after his death,
which bore date January 19th, 1715. Cibber (p. 174) relates that
Steele assigned to Wilks, Booth, and himself, equal shares in this
Patent. All went smoothly for more than two years, until the
appointment of the Duke of Newcastle (April 13th, 1717) as Lord
Chamberlain. He seems soon to have begun to interfere in the
affairs of the theatre. Steele, in the eighth number of "The
Theatre," states that shortly after his appointment the Duke demanded
that he should resign his Patent and accept a Licence in
its place. This Steele naturally and rightly declined to do, and
here the matter rested for many months. With reference to this
it is interesting to note that among the Lord Chamberlain's
Papers is the record of a consultation of the Attorney-General
whether Steele's Patent made him independent of the Lord
Chamberlain's authority. Unfortunately it is impossible to decide,
from the terms of the queries put to the Attorney-General, whether
these were caused by aggressive action on Steele's part, or merely
by his defence of his rights.</p>

<p>The next molestation was an order, dated December 19th, 1719,
addressed to Steele, Wilks, and Booth, ordering them to dismiss
Cibber; which they did. His suspension, for it was nothing more,
lasted till January 28th, 1720. Steele, in the seventh number of
"The Theatre," January 23rd, 1720, alludes to his suspension as
then existing, and in No. 12 talks of Cibber's being just restored
to the "Begging Bridge," that is, the theatre. The allusion is to
an Apologue by Steele ("Reader," No. II.) which Cibber quotes,
and applies to Steele, in his Dedication of "Ximena" to him. A
peasant had succeeded in barricading, with his whole belongings,
a bridge over which an enemy attempted to invade his native
country. He kept them back till his countrymen were roused;
but when the forces of his friends attacked the enemy, the peasant's
property was destroyed in the fray and he was left destitute. He
received no compensation, but it was enacted that he and his
descendants were alone to have the privilege of <i>begging</i> on this
bridge. Cibber applies this fable to the treatment of Steele by
the Lord Chamberlain, and there can be no doubt that this Dedication
must have caused great offence to that official, and contributed
materially to Cibber's suspension, though Steele declared
that the attack upon his partner was merely intended as an oblique
attack on himself. The author of the "Answer to the Case of
Sir Richard Steele," 1720 (Nichols's ed., p. 532), says that Cibber
had offended the Duke by an attack on the King and the Ministry
in the Dedication of his "Ximena" to Steele. He also says that
when the Chamberlain wanted a certain actor to play a part which
belonged to one of the managers, Cibber flatly refused to allow
him, and was thereupon silenced. (The actor is said to have
been Elrington, and the part Torrismond; but I doubt if Elrington
was at Drury Lane in 1719-20.) A recent stage historian
curiously says that the play which gave offence was "The Nonjuror,"
which is about as likely as that a man should be accused
of high treason because he sang "God Save the Queen!"</p>

<p>Steele then, being made to understand that the attack on Cibber
was the beginning of evil directed against himself, wrote to two great
Ministers of State, and presented a Petition to the King on January
22nd, 1720, praying to be protected from molestation by the Lord
Chamberlain. The result of this action was a revocation of Steele's
Licence (<i>not</i> his Patent specially, which is curious) dated January
23rd, 1720; and on the next Monday, the 25th, an Order for
Silence was sent to the managers and actors at Drury Lane. The
theatre accordingly remained closed Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,
January 25th to 27th, 1720, and on the 28th re-opened,
Wilks, Cibber, and Booth having made their submission and
received a Licence dated the previous day.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March following the actors of Drury Lane were
sworn at the Lord Chamberlain's office, "pursuant to an Order
occasioned by their acting in obedience to his Majesty's Licence,
lately granted, exclusive of a Patent formerly obtained by Sir
Richard Steele, Knight." The tenor of the Oath was, that as his
Majesty's Servants they should act subservient to the Lord
Chamberlain, Vice-Chamberlain, and Gentleman-Usher in Waiting.
Whether Steele took any steps to test the legality of this treatment
is doubtful; but, on the accession of his friend Walpole to office,
he was restored to his position at the head of the theatre. On
May 2nd, 1721, Cibber and his partners were ordered to account
with Steele for his past and present share of the profits of the
theatre, as if all the regulations from which his name had been
excluded had never been made. This edict is signed by the Duke
of Newcastle, and must, I fancy, have been rather a bitter pill for
that nobleman. How Steele subsequently conducted himself,
and how much interest he took in the theatre, Cibber very fully
relates in the next few pages. After Steele's death a new Patent
was granted to Cibber, Wilks, and Booth, as will be related further
on. It may be noted here, however, that the date of the new
Patent proves conclusively that Steele's grant was never superseded.
The new power was dated July 3rd, 1731, but it did not
take effect till September 1st, 1732, exactly three years after
Steele's death, according to the terms of his original Patent.</p>

 This is one of Cibber's bad blunders. The Case was heard
in 1728. Genest (iii. 208) refers to the <i>St. James's Evening Post's</i>
mention of the hearing; and, in the Burney MSS. in the British
Museum, a copy of the paragraph is given. It is not, however, a
cutting, but a manuscript copy. "Saty. Feb. 17. There was an
hearing in the Rolls Chapel in a Cause between Sir Richard
Steele, Mr. Cibber, Mr. Wilks, and others belonging to Drury-Lane
Theatre, which held five hours&mdash;one of which was taken up
by a speech of Mr. Wilks, which had so good an effect, that the
Cause went against Sir Richard Steele."&mdash;St. James's Evening
Post, Feb. 17 to Feb. 20, 1728. In its next issue, Feb. 20 to
Feb. 22, it corrects the blunder which it had made in attributing
Cibber's speech to Wilks.</p>

 Boman, or Bowman, was born about 1651, and lived till 23rd
March, 1739. He made his first appearance about 1673, and
acted to within a few months of his death, having thus been on
the stage for the extraordinary period of sixty-five years. He was
very sensitive on the subject of his age, and, if asked how old he
was, only replied, that he was very well. Davies speaks highly of
Boman's acting in his extreme old age ("Dram. Misc.," i. 286 and

 Davies ("Dram. Misc.," i. 365) says: "Wolsey's filching from
his royal master the honour of bestowing grace and pardon on the
subject, appeared so gross and impudent a prevarication, that,
when this play was acted before George I. at Hampton-Court,
about the year 1717, the courtiers laughed so loudly at this ministerial
craft, that his majesty, who was unacquainted with the
English language, asked the lord-chamberlain the meaning of their
mirth; upon being informed of it, the king joined in a laugh of
approbation." Davies adds that this scene "was not unsuitably
represented by Colley Cibber;" but, in scenes requiring dignity or
passion, he expresses an unfavourable opinion of Cibber's playing.</p>

If the performance was at Hampton Court, or if it took place at

 After the death of Wilks and Booth, and the retirement of
Cibber, the stage experienced a period of dulness, which was the
natural result of the want of good young talent in the lifetime of
the old actors. Such periods seem to recur at stated intervals in
the history of the stage.</p>

 Davies ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 255) has the following interesting
statement regarding Cibber and Wilks, which he gives on Victor's
authority:&mdash;</p>

<p>"However Colley may complain, in his Apology, of Wilks's fire
and impetuosity, he in general was Cibber's great admirer; he
supported him on all occasions, where his own passion or interest
did not interpose; nay, he deprived the inoffensive Harry Carey
of the liberty of the scenes, because he had, in common with
others, made merry with Cibber in a song, on his being appointed
poet laureat; saying at the same time, he was surprised at his
impertinence, in behaving so improperly <i>to a man of such great
merit</i>."</p>

 John Dennis, in an advertisement to the "Invader of his
Country," remarks on this foible. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am perfectly satisfied that any Author who brings a Play to

of this fine Writer, unless he has either a powerful Cabal, or
unless he will flatter Mr. <i>Robert Wilks</i>, and make him believe
that he is an excellent Tragedian." The "fine Writer" is, of
course, Cibber.</p>

 "In the trajedy of <i>Mackbeth</i>, where <i>Wilks</i> acts the Part of

Wildness of his Passion, which is run over in a Torrent of calamitous
Circumstances, does but raise my Spirits and give me the
Alarm; but when he skilfully seems to be out of Breath, and is
brought too low to say more; and upon a second Reflection, cry,
only wiping his Eyes, What, both my Children! Both, both my
Children gone&mdash;There is no resisting a Sorrow which seems to
have cast about for all the Reasons possible for its Consolation,
but has no Recource. There is not one left, but both, both are
murdered! Such sudden Starts from the Thread of the Discourse,

Strokes of Eloquence and Poetry."&mdash;"Tatler," No. 68, September

 Charles Williams was a young actor of great promise, who
died in 1731. On the production of Thomson's "Sophonisba"
at Drury Lane, on February 28th, 1730, Cibber played Scipio,
but was so hissed by a public that would not suffer him in tragic
parts, that he resigned the character to Williams. (See Footnote 201,
vol. i. anchored on page 179.) This would seem to indicate that Williams was
an actor of some position, for Scipio is a good part.</p>

 "In the strong expression of horror on the murder of the
King, and the loud exclamations of surprize and terror, Booth
might have exceeded the utmost efforts of Wilks. But, in the
touches of domestic woe, which require the feelings of the tender
father and the affectionate husband, Wilks had no equal. His
skill, in exhibiting the emotions of the overflowing heart with
corresponding look and action, was universally admired and felt.
His rising, after the suppression of his anguish, into ardent and
manly resentment, was highly expressive of noble and generous
anger."&mdash;"Dram. Misc.," ii. 183.</p>

 Jeremy Collier specially attacked Vanbrugh and his comedies
for their immorality and profanity, and for their abuse of the
clergy. Even less strict critics than Collier considered Vanbrugh's
pieces as more indecent than the average play. Thus the author
of "Faction Display'd," 1704, writes:&mdash;</p>

"with alterations."</p>

out to see it, "out of Curiosity to observe how <i>Wilks</i> and <i>Cibber</i>

 Jeanne Catherine Gaussin, a very celebrated actress of the
Com√©die Fran√ßaise, was the original representative of Za√Øre, in
Voltaire's tragedy, to which Cibber refers. She made her first
Parisian appearance in 1731; she retired in 1763, and died on
9th June, 1767. Voltaire's "Za√Øre" owed much of its success to
her extraordinary ability.</p>

 Cibber has been strongly censured for his treatment of authors.
"The Laureat" gives the following account of an author's experiences:
"<i>The Court sitting, Chancellor Cibber</i> (for the other two,
like M&mdash;&mdash;rs in <i>Chancery</i>, sat only for Form sake, and did not
presume to judge) nodded to the Author to open his Manuscript.
The Author begins to read, in which if he failed to please the <i>Corrector</i>,
he wou'd condescend sometimes to read it for him: When,
if the play strook him very warmly, as it wou'd if he found any
Thing new in it, in which he conceived he cou'd particularly shine
as an Actor, he would lay down his Pipe, (for the <i>Chancellor</i>
always smoaked when he made a Decree) and cry, <i>By G&mdash;d there
is something in this: I do not know but it may do; but I will play
such a Part</i>. Well, when the Reading was finished, he made
his proper Corrections and sometimes without any Propriety;
nay, frequently he very much and very hastily maimed what he
pretended to mend" (p. 95). The author also accuses Cibber
of delighting in repulsing dramatic writers, which he called
"Choaking of Singing birds." However, in Cibber's defence,
Genest's opinion may be quoted (iii. 346): "After all that has
been said against Chancellor Cibber, it does not appear that
he often made a wrong decree: most of the good plays came out
at Drury Lane&mdash;nor am I aware that Cibber is much to be blamed
for rejecting any play, except the Siege of Damascus in the first
instance."</p>

 In the preface to "The Lunatick" (1705) the actors are
roundly abused; but the most amusing attack on actors is in the
following title-page: "The Sham Lawyer: or the Lucky Extravagant.
As it was <i>Damnably</i> Acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury
Lane." This play, by Drake, was played in 1697, and among the
cast were Cibber, Bullock, Johnson, Haines, and Pinkethman.
</p>
<p>
Bellchambers notes: "Such was the case in Dennis's 'Comic
Gallant,' where one of the actors, whom I believe to be Bullock,
is most severely handled." I think he is wrong in imagining Bullock
to be the actor criticised. Dennis says that Falstaffe was the
character that was badly sustained, and I cannot believe Bullock's
position would entitle him to play that part in 1702. Genest (ii.
250) suggests Powell as the delinquent.</p>

 Cibber's account of Booth is so complete that there is little
to be added to it. Booth was born in 1681, and was of a good
English family. He first appeared in Dublin in 1698, under
Ashbury, but returned to England in 1700, and joined the
Lincoln's Inn Fields Company. He followed the fortunes of
Betterton until, as related by Cibber in Chapter XII., the secession
of 1709 occurred. From that point to his retirement the only
event demanding special notice is his marriage with Hester
Santlow (see p. 96 of this volume). This took place in 1719,
and was the cause of much criticism and slander, some of which
Bellchambers reproduces with evident gusto. I do not repeat
his statements, because I consider them wildly extravagant.
They are fully refuted by Booth's will, from the terms of which
it is clear that his marriage was a happy one, and that he
esteemed his wife as well as loved her. Booth's illness, to which
Cibber refers above, seized him early in the season of 1726-27,
and though after it he was able to play occasionally, he was
never restored to health. His last appearance was on 9th
January, 1728, but he lived till 10th May, 1733.</p>

 Wilks died 27th September, 1732. He was of English
parentage, and was born near Dublin, whither his father had
removed, about 1665. He was in a Government office, but
about 1691 he gave this up, and went on the stage. After a
short probation in Dublin he came over to London, and was
engaged by Rich, with whom he remained till about 1695. He
returned to Dublin, and became so great a favourite there, that it
is said that the Lord Lieutenant issued a warrant to prevent his
leaving again for London. However, he came to Drury Lane
about 1698, and from that time his fortunes are closely interwoven
with Cibber's, and are fully related by him.</p>

show that he thought him no common adversary, he prepared no

 Mr. Laurence Hutton, in his "Literary Landmarks of London"
(p. 54), gives the following interesting particulars regarding
Cibber's last resting-place: "Cibber was buried by the side of
his father and mother, in a vault under the Danish Church,
situated in Wellclose Square, Ratcliff Highway (since named
St. George Street). This church, according to an inscription
placed over the doorway, was built in 1696 by Caius Gabriel
Cibber himself, by order of the King of Denmark, for the use of
such of his Majesty's subjects as might visit the port of London.
The church was taken down some years ago (1868-70), and St.
Paul's Schools were erected on its foundation, which was left
intact. Rev. Dan. Greatorex, Vicar of the Parish of St. Paul,
Dock Street, in a private note written in the summer of 1883,
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Colley Cibber and his father and mother were buried in the
vault of the old Danish Church. When the church was removed,
the coffins were all removed carefully into the crypt under the
apse, and then bricked up. So the bodies are still there. The
Danish Consul was with me when I moved the bodies. The
coffins had perished except the bottoms. I carefully removed
them myself personally, and laid them side by side at the back of
the crypt, and covered them with earth.'"</p>

 Vide Davies's "Dramatic Miscellanies," vol. iii. p. 264.</p>

<p>Another anecdote of the same kind is found in a "Life of the late
famous comedian, J. Haynes," 8vo. 1701, which, as it preserves a
characteristic trait of this valuable actor, is worth repeating.</p>

<p>"About this time [1673] there happened a small pick between
Mr. Hart and Jo, upon the account of his late negotiation in France,{A}
and there spending so much money to so little purpose, or, as I may
more properly say, to no purpose at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>{A} Soon after the theatre in Drury-lane was burnt down, Jan. 1671-2, Haynes had
been sent to Paris by Mr. Hart and Mr. Killegrew, to examine the machinery
employed in the French Operas.&mdash;<i>Malone.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"There happened to be one night a play acted, called 'Cataline's
Conspiracy,' wherein there was wanting a great number of senators.
Now Mr. Hart being chief of the house, would oblige Jo to dress for
one of these senators, although his salary, being 50<i>s.</i> per week, freed
him from any such obligation. But Mr. Hart, as I said before, being
sole governor of the playhouse, and at a small variance with Jo, commands
it, and the other must obey.</p>

<p>"Jo being vexed at the slight Mr. Hart had put upon him, found out
this method of being revenged on him. He gets a Scaramouch dress,
a large full ruff, makes himself whiskers from ear to ear, puts on his
head a long Merry-Andrew's cap, a short pipe in his mouth, a little
three-legged stool in his hand; and in this manner follows Mr. Hart
on the stage, sets himself down behind him, and begins to smoke his
pipe, laugh, and point at him, which comical figure put all the house
in an uproar, some laughing, some clapping, and some hollaing. Now
Mr. Hart, as those who knew him can aver, was a man of that exactness
and grandeur on the stage, that let what would happen, he'd never
discompose himself, or mind any thing but what he then represented;
and had a scene fallen behind him, he would not at that time look back,
to have seen what was the matter; which Jo knowing, remained still
smoking. The audience continued laughing, Mr. Hart acting, and
wondering at this unusual occasion of their mirth; sometimes thinking
it some disturbance in the house, again that it might be something
amiss in his dress: at last turning himself toward the scenes, he discovered
Jo in the aforesaid posture; whereupon he immediately goes
off the stage, swearing he would never set foot on it again, unless Jo
was immediately turned out of doors, which was no sooner spoke, but
put in practice."</p>

 Bellamente is not a female, but a male character. By referring to

 "My old friends Hart and Mohun, the one by his natural and proper
force, the other <i>by his great skill and art</i>, never failed to send me

<p><a name="Footnote_234" id="Footnote_234"></a><a href="#FNanchor_234">
<span class="label">[234]</span></a>
 The following extract from a pamphlet, called "A Comparison
between the Two Stages," will amply evince the popular estimation in
which Hart and Mohun were held:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The late Duke of Monmouth was a good judge of dancing, and a
good dancer himself; when he returned from France, he brought with
him St Andr√©, then the best master in France. The duke presented
him to the stage, the stage to gratify the duke admitted him, and the
duke himself thought he would prove a mighty advantage to them,
though he had nobody else of his opinion. A day was published in
the bills for him to dance, but not one more, besides the duke and his
friends came to see him; the reason was, the plays were then so good,
and Hart and Mohun acted them so well, that the audience would not
be interrupted, for so short a time, though 'twas to see the best master
in Europe."</p>

<p>I suspect that Mohun was born about the year 1625, from the circumstance
of his acting <i>Bellamente</i>, the heroine of Shirley's "Love's
Cruelty," in 1640, when he had probably reached, and could hardly
have exceeded, the age of fifteen years. (B.) As has been before
pointed out, Bellamente is not a female character. He is the husband
of Clariana, and could scarcely be played by a boy. If Mohun represented
the character in 1640, he must have been considerably older
than Bellchambers imagines. (L.)</p>

 "I have lately been told by a Gentleman who has frequently seen
Mr. <i>Betterton</i> perform this Part of <i>Hamlet</i>, that he has observ'd his
Countenance (which was naturally ruddy and sanguin) in this Scene of
the fourth Act where his Father's Ghost appears, thro' the violent and
sudden Emotions of Amazement and Horror, turn instantly on the
Sight of his Father's Spirit, as pale as his Neckcloath, when every
Article of his Body seem'd to be affected with a Tremor inexpressible;
so that, had his Father's Ghost actually risen before him; he could
not have been seized with more real Agonies; and this was felt so
strongly by the Audience, that the Blood seemed to shudder in their
Veins likewise, and they in some Measure partook of the Astonishment
and Horror, with which they saw this excellent Actor affected."&mdash;"Laureat,"

 "That Verbruggen and Cibber did not accord, is plainly insinuated
by the author of the Laureat. It was known that the former would
resent an injury, and that the latter's valour was entirely passive. The
temper of Verbruggen may be known, from a story which I have often
been told by the old comedians as a certain fact, and which found its
way into some temporary publication.</p>

<p>"Verbruggen, in a dispute with one of King Charles's illegitimate
sons, was so far transported by sudden anger, as to strike him, and
call him a son of a whore. The affront was given, it seems, behind
the scenes of Drury-lane. Complaint was made of this daring insult
on a nobleman, and Verbruggen was told, he must either not act in
London, or submit publicly to ask the nobleman's pardon. During
the time of his being interdicted acting, he had engaged himself to
Betterton's theatre. He consented to ask pardon, on liberty granted
to express his submission in his own terms. He came on the stage
dressed for the part of <i>Oroonoko</i>, and, after the usual preface, owned
that he had called the Duke of St. A. a son of a whore. 'It is true,'
said Verbruggen, 'and I am sorry for it.' On saying this, he invited
the company present to see him act the part of <i>Oroonoko</i>, at the
theatre in Lincoln's-inn-fields."&mdash;"Dramatic Miscellanies," vol. iii.

She lived successively with Arthur Mainwaring, one of the most
accomplished characters of his age, and General Churchill; by each of
whom she had a son.</p>

 Savage, however, was <i>not</i> silent; though he abstained from
putting his name to the poem, he indisputably wrote upon Mrs. Oldfield's
death. It is preserved in Chetwood's "History."</p>

 What can be more ridiculous than the following anecdote?
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Oldfield happened to be in some danger in a Gravesend boat,
and when the rest of the passengers lamented their imagined approaching
fate, she, with a conscious dignity, told them their deaths would be
only a private loss;&mdash;"But I am a public concern."&mdash;"Dramatic
Miscellanies," vol. i. p. 227.</p>

 The bitterness of Pope's muse subsided upon no occasion, where
the name of Mrs. Oldfield might be aptly introduced. Thus in the
"Sober Advice from Horace," one of his inedited poems:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Engaging Oldfield! who, with grace and ease,</div>
<div class="i0">Could join the arts to ruin and to please.</div>
</div></div>
